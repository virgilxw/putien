Finally, at the home of the Fushou who is holding the last incense burner of the previous year, three Daoist ritual masters conduct a Jiao ritual. There were originally only three Fushou but now there are seven. There are three basic requirements for becoming a Fushou. The person has to: 1) take part in the Chunzhai 春斋 Spring Fast (purification) in the first year, and 2) agree to host the Chujiuzao 初九早 (a kind of banquet held on the ninth day of the New Year); and to 3) invite the xianglao 乡老 Village Elders to the feast. Only then can the person become a Fushou in the third year.","['Houtu furen', 'Zunzhu mingwang']"
