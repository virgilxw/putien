The Xu used to be the long-term workers for the Zhang surname group. For unknown reasons, the Zhang no longer live in the village. The Xu make up three quarters of the entire population of the village, while the Lin make up one quarter. The origins of the Xu are unclear, nonetheless, formerly Xu surnamed people from Xudi \u8bb8\u5730 in the Jiewai \u754c\u5916 (areas subjected to coastal evacuation) visited Qiandun and claimed to share the same ancestors. It is said that during the Ming Dynasty, there were two high ministers (shangshu) \u5c1a\u4e66 from Putian \u8386\u7530 at the court, one from Xibai \u6eaa\u767d surnamed Fang \u65b9 and the other by the surname of Xu from Qiandun village. When they were returning to their homes, a dispute arose as they both wanted to use the water from a stream at the foot of the Jiuhuashan mountain \u4e5d\u534e\u5c71. Minister Xu wanted to use the stream for irrigation purposes while Minister Fang wanted to use it for making tea. The result of the dispute was to drill a hole in the rock that would allow only a small amount of the water to flow to Xibai, while the majority of the water flowed to irrigate the agricultural fields of Qiandun \u524d\u58a9. This dispute made Minister Fang very angry and vengeful. He threw a lot of weapons into a deep pond located in the mountains behind Qiandun. Then he went to the emperor and told him that Minister Xu was preparing to overthrow the reign of the emperor by making weapons and assembling armies. When the emperor sent people to verify these claims, they found many weapons in the deep pond near Qiandun. Thus minister Xu and all his relations to the third degree were killed. One descendant of Minister Xu fled to the Jiewai \u754c\u5916 (land beyond the limits). They added two strokes in front of the Xu character (\u8bb8) so it became Xu (\u51ab\u8bb8 ). This is the reason behind the Xu (\u51ab\u8bb8) people coming to Houzhuo \u540e\u5353 to identify their common ancestry. The Xu \u8bb8 are divided into four branches in the village: first branch \u5934\u623f, second branch \u4e8c\u623f, third branch \u4e09\u623f, and fourth branch \u56db\u623f.
