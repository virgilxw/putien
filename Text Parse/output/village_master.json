The area was originally part of the Houjipu 后积铺 of Dongxiang 东乡and the Chengkoupu 程口铺 (police/defense units) of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In the Ming there were already the villages of Dongzhang 东张, Houji 后积, Chengkou 澄口, and Yangbin 洋滨. In the Qing, the villages of Qicuo 歧厝 and Louxia 楼下 separated off. Currently the population is over 8000 people, divided into three Administrative Villages, namely Dongfeng 东风, Tingjiang 汀江 and Tingfeng 汀峰. The Wanlinggong 万灵宫 temple, located in Houji village, is the main overall temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main god is Kong Daren 孔大人 and Wulu jiangjun 五路将军. Each year on lunar 1/29 to 2/2, Wulu jiangjun is carried in a procession to the villages of the sevenfold ritual alliance. Every sixty years, Kong Daren is carried in a great procession around scores of villages in the vicinity.

The origins of the Xu are unclear, nonetheless, formerly Xu surnamed people from Xudi 许地 in the Jiewai 界外 (areas subjected to coastal evacuation) visited Qiandun and claimed to share the same ancestors. It is said that during the Ming Dynasty, there were two high ministers (shangshu) 尚书 from Putian 莆田 at the court, one from Xibai 溪白 surnamed Fang 方 and the other by the surname of Xu from Qiandun village. When they were returning to their homes, a dispute arose as they both wanted to use the water from a stream at the foot of the Jiuhuashan mountain 九华山. Minister Xu wanted to use the stream for irrigation purposes while Minister Fang wanted to use it for making tea. The result of the dispute was to drill a hole in the rock that would allow only a small amount of the water to flow to Xibai, while the majority of the water flowed to irrigate the agricultural fields of Qiandun 前墩. This dispute made Minister Fang very angry and vengeful. He threw a lot of weapons into a deep pond located in the mountains behind Qiandun. Then he went to the emperor and told him that Minister Xu was preparing to overthrow the reign of the emperor by making weapons and assembling armies. When the emperor sent people to verify these claims, they found many weapons in the deep pond near Qiandun. Thus minister Xu and all his relations to the third degree were killed. One descendant of Minister Xu fled to the Jiewai 界外 (land beyond the limits). They added two strokes in front of the Xu character (许) so it became Xu (冫许 ). This is the reason behind the Xu (冫许) people coming to Houzhuo 后卓 to identify their common ancestry. The Xu 许 are divided into four branches in the village: first branch 头房, second branch 二房, third branch 三房, and fourth branch 四房.

Xiadun 下墩 1. Village settlement The village of Xiadun has a population of over 800 people living in over 150 households. The main livelihood is farming, supplemented by lychee trees and fishing. According to local legend, the deep channel behind the village was known as the Turtle Channel, and was the lair of a turtle demon. Every time the weather changed, he would rise up out of his hole and float on the surface of the water. Then he would gobble up the spirits of the men of the neighboring village of Loutou 漏头, causing them to wither and decline. Later a geomancer destroyed the turtle, and its corpse floated to the surface. Thus in the channel there formed a small islet surrounded by water, where the village of Xiadun 下墩 formed. Currently the village sets up a red banner when they race their dragon boats. 2. Surname groups The village is made up of only the Lin 林 and the Chen 陈. The Xiadun Lin came from Shanglin village, while the Chen came from Kuokou 阔口 outside Putian city. 3. Village temples 1) Xiadunjing Longboshê 下墩境龙波社 branched off from the Shanglin Longboshê 上林龙波社.
