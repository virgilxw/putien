It is located between the Houyang main channel 后洋大沟 of the Mulan 木兰 irrigation system and the coastal sea dikes below the mouth of the Mulan river, near the Dongshan sluice-gate. It was originally part of the Zouzengxupu 邹曾 徐铺 of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In this area in the Ming there already was a village called Zou Zeng Xu 邹曾徐. Currently, the population of Dongshan is over 10,000 people, and it is managed by two Administrative Villages: Dongshan 东山行政村 and Dongyuan 东源行政村. The temple ritual system is divided on the basis of residence and lineage into the four shê ritual associations of Shangzou 上邹, Xiazou 下邹, Dongcuo 东厝, and Zhengcuo 郑厝. The Chongjiaogong 崇教宫 of Shangzou village 上邹 (see below) is the main temple for the four shê ritual association. The two main surnames of this area are the Zou 邹 and the Zheng 郑. The Zou have over 6000 people. The Zou ancestors are said to have emigrated from Zou county of Shandong province 山东邹县 to Putian 莆田 during the Jianyan period of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127–1130). In the Ming dynasty, the Zou were a prominent lineage with many successful examination Dongshan four shê ritual alliance graduates. They produced two Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan Graduates) and seven Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates). The Fancan Family Temple 藩参 家庙, first built in Ming Jiajing 29 (1550) and still extant, is the ancestral lineage hall of the Zou of Dongshan 东山, as well as of the Zou of Xindu 新度 and Xiyuan 西园, etc. In the feuding banner alliances of the late Qing, the four shê of Dongshan were part of the black banner alliance.",['Mao']
