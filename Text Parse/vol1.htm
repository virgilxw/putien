Since the end of the Cultural Revolution and the change of official policies regard- ing religious activity in 1979, thousands of temples have been rebuilt, local ritual traditions have been reinvented, and esoteric rites have been slowly reassembled or improvised across the Putian plain. These volumes demonstrate the importance of these rituals dedicated to the gods by the villagers in this region by showing their distribution and frequency in every village on the plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">We found that village temples, and ritual alliances they have formed, generate a “second government” which addresses certain local con- cerns more effectively than the state and its local government officials (Dean 2001). The village temples are at the center of the celebrations of the birthdays and festivals of the gods. They organize processions of villagers that trace the boundaries of their ritual territories and alli- ances. They hold training sessions for spirit mediums who transmit the blessings of the gods to each household in the village. Village temples also invite Daoist and other ritual specialists to perform rites inside the temple as the processions, spirit medium exorcistic dances, and opera performances go on outside. They are also important centers of local political, economic, social and moral power. The temples are living cultural centers of the villages. During idle moments, they provide a place for the elderly to gather and play cards or mahjong, while indi- vidual worshippers burn incense and present offerings to the gods, and children play. Village rituals centered on these temples are continu- ing to successfully negotiate the forces of capitalism and nationalism while preserving a vibrant space for the celebration of local cultural difference.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">This volume is designed to provide an introduction to the sur-</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">vey, and to put the “return of the gods” to the Putian plains over the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">past three decades into historical context. This volume begins with a chapter summarizing the survey and its main findings, including a description of the way in which the survey entries are organized. This is followed by a chapter discussing the limitations of official defini- tions of religion in China for an understanding of the village temples and their ritual activities, along with some suggestions for alternative approaches. Chapter Three provides a rapid overview of the historical development of aspects of the rituals one finds on the Putian plains today. Chapters Four and Five describes ritual events in contemporary Putian, and introduce the different ritual specialists who perform in them. Chapter Six introduces the principal gods and cults worshipped on the plain. Chapter Seven reviews the most prominent temples, monasteries and important village temples found on the Putian plain. Chapter Eight discusses the major lineages distributed over the plain, and presents a detailed case study of the interaction between lineage and territorial temples in Shiting village. Chapter Nine examines the Overseas Chinese connections to Southeast Asia which have brought new kinds of ritual innovation into the local culture. Chapter Ten offers some theoretical reflections on the syncretic ritual field of Chi- nese popular religion and the interaction of ritual and modernity in contemporary Putian. In Part Two, we present a translation of an essay entitled <i>Lineage and religion on the Putian plains: an analysis based on stone inscriptions</i>, by Zheng Zhenman, which provides more historical documentation on some key phases in the history of the local ritual system, for specialist readers. A series of appendices include the origin accounts and maps of the distributions of the main lineages of the Putian plains and a translation of a recent stone inscriptions.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">This format, which first describes a survey, then outlines the history</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of the region, and next introduces the key elements of contemporary ritual events in the area, inevitably involves some degree of repetition, if not contradiction, for which we apologize to readers in advance. Throughout this volume we raise the question of what these complex village rites and processions tell us about the nature of ritual, com- munity and identity in Southeast China. Chinese village rituals in this area incorporate many different liturgical frameworks and allow for multiple points of view, all the while mobilizing the entire village pop- ulation into celebrations for the gods. These rites are an intensification of everyday life, featuring an acceleration of the flow of gifts and com- petitive displays of local power, rather than a sacred or solemn time set</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 5</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">apart from some mundane realm. These ritual events thus pose very interesting challenges to Western categories of religion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An amazing resurgence of popular local religion</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Villagers in Putian often joke that when Mao Zedong was on earth, he scared all the gods away to heaven. Now that Mao himself has gone to heaven, the gods have come hurrying back to earth. Nowadays it is not Red Guards who tear down temples to the popular gods. Hyper- development flattens whole villages and temples in the rush to expand cities and towns. But the gods are still important to local people, and their rituals are at the center of a struggle for relative local autonomy and cultural self-definition. Since 1979, with the ending of the Cul- tural Revolution and the beginning of the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, a massive resurgence and re-invention of local ritual tradi- tions, perhaps the greatest in history, has taken place across China. We estimate that over a million village temples have been rebuilt or restored across China, and ritual traditions long thought lost are now being celebrated in many of these temples.<span class="s9">1 </span>These are the temples of Chinese local popular religion, although as we will see below, this term is problematic. This figure does not include the tens of thousands of large scale Buddhist monasteries, Daoist monasteries and temples, Islamic mosques, or Christian churches (Catholic or Protestant) that were rebuilt or restored over the past three decades. In other words, these village temples do not easily fit into the five officially recognized</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">1 </span>According to one recent count China currently has a total number of 680,000 administrative villages. Statement by Yu Zhan, Vice Director of the Chinese Associa- tion for Promoting Township and Village Development, quoted in the <i>Peoples’ Daily Online </i><a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/" class="a" target="_blank">on May 30, 2005. Cite last accessed 4/25/2009. </a>http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/ 200505/30/eng20050530_187563.html. Administrative villages often include from one to several natural villages. Reports on villages from many regions of China suggest that it is reasonable to assume an average of two temples per village (see the summaries in Overmyer, 2000 of several hundred field reports published in Lagerwey, et al., (1994–) and Wang Chiu-kuei, (1993–). If we assume an average village population of 1000, we arrive at a figure of over 680 million villagers involved in some way with over a million temples and their rituals. It should be noted however that in some areas of China temples have only very rarely been rebuilt since 1949. This can be attributed to local poverty and complex local political conditions, amongst other local historical factors. Recent in-depth anthropological and historical studies dealing with the revival of temples in recent decades in different parts of China include Dean (1993, 1998), Jing (1996), Chao (2006) and Dubois (2005).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">religions of China (Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Catholicism, Protes- tantism). In many areas these village temples have been classified as Daoist by the local offices of the Religious Affairs Bureau.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">China’s towns and cities have been the main centers of political control, rapid economic transformation, and secularization over the past fifty years since the founding of the People’s Republic. The once active temples and ritual activities of these towns and cities have, for the most part, been closed down or museumified, generating a grow- ing gulf between the experiences of urban as opposed to rural Chi- nese.<span class="s9">2 </span>The situation is very different in the rural sector. The numbers of village temples and the extent of their ritual activities have grown rapidly over the past thirty years. A substantial amount of the money remitted by the 200 million strong “floating population” of rural work- ers in urban construction sites and factories around China to their home villages supports the ritual activities documented in this book. While the stereotypical images of China under the Cultural Revolution slowly die away in the minds of outside observers, they have mostly been replaced by images of hyper-development in urban settings like Beijing and Shanghai. The everyday life of rural China and its ritual underpinnings remains scarcely understood. The role of local ritual traditions in this daily life is the subject of this book.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">This book provides an in-depth introduction to the socio-cultural</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">historical background and a survey of contemporary ritual activities in the irrigated alluvial plain which formed along the Xinghua <span class="s8">興 化 </span>bay of Putian county in Fujian province in Southeast China.<span class="s9">3 </span>This plain extends from Putian city in the east to the Xinghua Bay on the west, and to the north and south of the Mulan <span class="s8">木 蘭 </span>river, covering a total of 464 sq. km.

We argue that this unexpected role for ritual in contemporary Chinese everyday life in this area is the result of the development of a multi-layered syncretic ritual field that can be analyzed historically. These evolving rituals have been an impor- tant factor in social organization historically, and they continue to play a crucial role in this area in contemporary China. We argue that the state and its officials and the lineages and their scholar-literati elites were not the only, nor necessarily the most important, agents of local social change and control. Instead, we emphasize the role of village temple and lineage leaders in creatively adapting and mutating vari- ous state institutions and ideas, along with lineage ideology and prac- tice, into sources of ritual change at the local level. They worked these cultural appropriations into a volatile and vital mix with local cults and ritual practices, which often involved spirit mediumism or spirit- writing. Of course, these temple leaders may also have been retired officials or scholar-literati with significant roles in local lineages, but their roles and powers within the temple committees were affected by practices of the rotation of responsibility and committee membership with all eligible married village males, and by the principle of collective decision making. These procedures ensured the expression of many different voices in the temple committees of the Putian plains. This too helps explain the ability of Putian villagers to continue to develop such a unique cultural ensemble of practices.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The contemporary flourishing of ritual activity should therefore be</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">seen as part of a long history of local control and management of local resources, dating back at least to the mid-Ming (mid-16th century). At that time, multi-village ritual alliances began to spread across the entire</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">4 <span class="s7">The term cult is here used in its original root sense of cultus, “to reverence”. The use of this term throughout this volume is not intended to refer in any pejorative way to “heterodox cults” or “evil cults” in the sense with which this term has been used in recent popular sociological literature. For a discussion of these issues see ter Haar, 1992.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Putian irrigated plain, and rituals specific to these regional organiza- tions were developed. This process took almost two hundred years to complete. Eventually, the plain was covered with alliances of indepen- dent natural villages,<span class="s9">5 </span>each of which held their own rituals and proces- sions for the gods in their own temples. The allied villages organized joint processions and rituals in higher-order, collectively managed central temples. There were multiple origins for these alliances—some formed to collectively manage the complex local irrigations systems, others formed when official altars to the soil and the harvest that had merged with local god temples branched out into newly settled vil- lages. Others formed in reaction to the proliferation of these alliances, or to protect themselves against dominant localized lineages.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Over several hundred years, a new form of local power began to evolve within the ritual alliances of the Putian plains. The temples and their alliances were able to mobilize the entire populations of the allied villages. They channeled considerable resources into the perfor- mance of local power, as seen in great processions and massive cel- ebrations held in higher-order central temples. This was a new kind of “ritual power formation”, which differed from the forms and flows of power within more isolated individual villages. The greater scale of the regional alliances required ritual events of greater intensity and complexity, involving more complex modes of regional local manage- ment and control of resources, and the mobilization of multiple village populations.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The mid-Ming also marks the moment when the local irrigation systems reached the limits of their physical expansion. These systems nevertheless were relied upon to provide for ever expanding local pop- ulations. These are complex systems, which work to regulate the flows of coastal tides and the distribution of fresh water through the plain, and which require elaborate and continuous monitoring, maintenance, and regular repair. The ritual alliances became the centers of irrigation maintenance. Over time, the ritual alliances were able to interact with,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_008.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">5 </span>Natural village, or <i>zirancun </i><span class="s11">自 然 村 </span>, is the local term for independent villages surrounded by rice paddies and vegetable fields, or by orchards and hills. The average population of the villages of the Putian plain is approximately 1,000 residents. Houses tend to be built side by side, with narrow lanes and alleys in between rows of houses. Most families have a small courtyard, but a larger public space is found in front of the village temple, and it is here that rice is threshed and dried after the harvest. Some older and larger villages have a short segment of paved road for temporary markets. In recent years, villages in this area have undergone extensive reconstruction.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 9</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">absorb, and in some cases go beyond the power of locally dominant lineages. This was a long process, which coincided with a general trend on the part of the late Ming and Qing state to download more respon- sibility for local governance onto local leadership. Meanwhile, society in Southeast China was becoming increasingly commercialized, and the temple alliances offered opportunities for the display of wealth in a socially acceptable form. Over this period, the lineages of the Putian plains also became more commercialized and transformed in many ways, merging in many areas with the temple organizations. During the late Ming and the Ming Qing transition (late 16th–mid 17th cen- turies), the Putian region was troubled by large scale pirate invasions, dynastic wars, and massive coastal evacuations enforced by the Man- chu court. All these disruptions accelerated the dispersal of lineages in the Putian plains, contributing to the current situation in which less than a third of villages are single surname villages.<span class="s9">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The village temples, ritual alliances and lineages of the Putian plains</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">suffered through a century of state-led attacks in the name of mod- ernization under the Republican period and in the first decades of the People’s Republic. Over the past thirty years, however, the tem- ple committees and regional ritual alliances of the Putian plains have regrouped and formed what might be called “China’s second govern- ment”. These organizations fulfill many functions of local self-gover- nance (Dean 2001). The temple committees raise considerable funding by collecting a set small amount from every household on a per capita basis (except for those Christian households that refuse to participate). Wealthy individuals are expected to contribute substantial funds to display their wealth and status and to reinvest in the community. All funds collected and dispersed are posted on the temple walls for all to see. The main expenses are for opera performances, ritual specialists, and the costs of the processions and rites. Extra funds are spent on many projects, such as sponsoring local infrastructure work, laying roads, building toilets, providing electric lighting, sponsoring cultural events (rituals invariably include operatic performances), sponsor- ing scholarships, dispensing charity, medicine, food and clothing, and providing a cultural center for the community.

There is a place for the display of status through individual contributions to village rituals, but there is also scope for the display of moral rectitude, regardless of one’s wealth, on the part of all those who take part in the rites. Equally, if not more important, the celebrations allow for all kinds of excitement, fun and chaotic tumult.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">“Traditional” practices in this part of China are not in flight before an encroaching, all encompassing modernity. On the contrary, the temple leaders who organize rituals in this region have shown a remarkable ability to negotiate the forces of modernity, whether from the state or from capital flows, incorporating these forces without distorting the celebrations into commercialized tourist spectacles or state-sponsored nationalist displays of “local cultural folklore”. This survey documents conclusively the resurgence and growth of popular religious ritual activity in Southeast China since the end of the Cultural Revolution. The survey also highlights the role of Overseas Chinese returning to help sponsor and participate in local ritual traditions and to invest in the rebuilding of temples and the performance of spectacular rituals. Many Putian villagers emigrated to Southeast Asia at the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century. Some of them set up branch tem- ples overseas of their village temple from the Putian plains. The survey shows the degree to which these transnational temple networks have revived from the late 1980’s onwards. These networks, which are often led by spirit medium groups, have become very active in the past thirty years. Many of these spirit mediums are also very successful Over- seas Chinese businessmen. The Overseas Chinese played an extremely important role in the revival of local culture in the years just after the Cultural Revolution, and continue to play an important role in some village rituals, but in fact, the vast majority of ritual events currently performed in the region are organized and funded locally. This is, after all, a region which has seen extraordinary economic growth over the past three decades.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Ritual Alliances</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As mentioned above, the ritual alliances of the Putian plains are groups of villages which perform regular common rituals, share a higher order</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 11</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">temple with a temple committee made up of representatives of each village in the alliance, and organize annual (or longer temporal cycles) processions of the gods through each of the villages in the alliance. These alliances are based in higher order temples. The gods of these temples are borrowed by smaller temples for rituals held there, or else they are formally received by these temples when they are carried in processions around the villages of the alliance. The ritual alliances spread across the plains from the 16th through the 18th century as different groups of multi-lineage villages formed coalitions. By the end of the 19th century, when the irrigation systems were in sharp decline, the ritual alliances transformed into competing banner coalitions that feuded amongst themselves over access to water rights. Over this long period of time, the ritual alliances took on many functions, including irrigation system maintenance, local displays of power in ritual events, local infrastructure (roads, bridges, village sanitation), charity, educa- tion, and local defense. Certain of these functions have been reclaimed by the ritual alliances since the beginning of the 1980’s.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The ritual alliances of the Putian plains have some similarities</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">with the village alliances described by Brim (1974) in the New Ter- ritories of Hong Kong. Brim claimed that the village alliances of the New Territories were deeply rooted in local level social structure. He described them as multi-lineage defensive alliances, and as para-politi- cal organizations that settle local and cross-boundary disputes with a formal legal code. They were also para-military organizations with formal militia units, who fought over land rent and the control of markets, and who could form military allegiances between alliances. Their functions included primarily defense, insurance, crop patrols, and irrigation maintenance. These alliances were also based in higher order temples, often in open country, which offered a wider range of ritual services than smaller, village temples. Large collective rites were held on the birthdays of the main gods of these temples, and every ten years a great Daoist <i>Jiao </i><span class="s8">醮 </span>ritual would be held. These rituals featured fighting over firework displays.<span class="s9">7</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_010.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">7 <span class="s7">Several of the higher order temples representing larger alliances of several multi- village ritual alliances on the Putian plain used to hold major rites and processions at regular intervals (every three, twelve, or sixty years). The increased economic prosper- ity of the region has led some of these long cycles to be sped up considerably. Thus the Temple of the Eastern Peak in Jiangkou on the northern coast of the Putian plain has held massive processions three times in the last fifteen years, rather than once every sixty years as had been the case in the Qing and Republican periods.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Faure (1986) argued that rather than treat the village alliances as static reflections of social structure, it is necessary to historicize them. He showed that the alliances arose in the 19th century, only after the decline of lineage control over many regions of the New Territories, and that the alliances differed considerably in their functions and his- torical development. Chun (2003) discussed the ongoing transforma- tions of the nature and functions of the village alliances, when British control had rendered their defensive functions moot, and after WWII, forces of globalization had further affected them. By the 1980’s they had changed into public spectacles, with little connection to their earlier social functions. Chun suggests that such changing social forms and functions should be understood in relation to shifting social milieus, changing local moral economies, and transformations at the level of broader societal disciplinary strategies.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The ritual alliances of the Putian plains also should be viewed from</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">multiple perspectives, sociological, historical, and cultural, as they evolved over time and as they continue to transform in response to forces of globalization. Clearly, they underwent a different historical process of evolution than in southern Guangdong and the New Ter- ritories. They arose earlier (16th century). They merged more intri- cately over the next several hundred years with lineage formations that were also expanding and transforming. They too developed defensive, militaristic dimensions in the 19th century, but they maintained other functions as well. Most surprisingly of all, they have survived attempts from the 1950’s through the 1970’s to impose homogenous political control over local culture.<span class="s9">8 </span>They have instead emerged resilient. What is  more,  they  have  so  far not  transformed  into  “public  spectacles” such as those described by Chun (2003), despite having to negotiate extremely volatile forces of the market. In general, one major differ- ence with the New Territories or the Pearl River delta of Guangdong (Faure 1986, 2007) lies in the local transformations of the lineages, which merged with the ritual alliances rather than remaining separate, or superseding them, or being replaced by them. The ritual alliances and the village temples continue to function as the main centers of cultural life today in the Putian plains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">8 <span class="s7">One could argue that the attacks on these local cultural forms began in the late Qing and were carried forward throughout the Republican period (see futher details in the historical overview below).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 13</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The gods worshipped in the village temples include a wide range of deified historical figures, some nationally known, but many known only in the village in which they are worshipped. There are also a broad range of nature deities, gods absorbed from popular myth, leg- end and fiction, along with many Buddhist gods, Daoist deities and immortals, or Confucian sages. Each distinct cultural region of China (often distinguished by a unique local dialect, style of architecture, cuisine, musical and theatrical traditions) will have its own unique local pantheon, combining locally invented deities with more widely worshipped gods. While the local pantheons of northern China gener- ally select between some 300 deities, many of classical origin, the local pantheons of south China are far more open to local innovation. The villagers in the Putian area worship over 1000 gods, over half of whom are local deities. Many of these highly local gods are worshipped in a single village, or at most within several villages in a ritual alliance.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">For the Western reader, it may be helpful to compare the situation</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">in Putian with that of ancient Greece, prior to the homogenization and standardization of the Olympian family melodrama of the gods, when the same god was often understood and worshipped very differently in different Grecian cities and cult sanctuaries (Larson 2007:3). Another point of comparison would be to the cults of the medieval Christian saints, some of whom were regarded as having special protective pow- ers over their cult centers (Wilson 1983). As we will see, the festivals of the gods of rural China are times of carnival and celebration. These ritual events are an intensification of both the ritualized basis as well as the joys and pleasures of everyday life. The communal rituals of the Putian plains are colorful, noisy, crowded, and exciting. They are exceedingly <i>renao </i>(hot and tumultuous). The largest ritual events dur- ing the <i>Yuanxiao </i><span class="s8">元宵 </span>festival involve spectacular processions of the gods, spirit mediums in trance, opera performances, Buddhist, Daoist, and/or Three in One rites,<span class="s9">9 </span>great arrays of food offerings in the temples (along with prepared tables of offerings in front of each household),</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">9 </span>The Three in One religious movement was founded in Putian by Lin Zhao’en<span class="s11">林兆恩 </span>(1517–1598). This movement combines Confucian self-cultivation, Daoist inner alchemy, and Buddhist meditation. The Three in One movement has built over 1,000 temples in Putian and Xianyou counties. They have developed a parallel ritual tradition to that of local Daoist ritual masters and Buddhist monks. Exceptionally elaborate ritual in Putian involve the performance of parallel rituals by any combina- tion of Daoists masters, Buddhist monks, and Three in One Scripture Masters. For more background on the Three in One movement, see Dean (1998).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">visits to the temple by a ceaseless stream of individual worshippers and delegations from nearby allied villages, musical performances by a competing array of performers including military brass bands, traditional instrumental ensembles, all female drum cart and cymbal troupes, loudspeakers broadcasting all kinds of music and announce- ments, and a cacophony of fireworks of all shapes and sizes. These ritual events involve the mobilization of the entire village community, or the populations of multiple villages—every one of whom has a rit- ual role to play. These roles change over the course of an individual’s life from carrying lanterns or bowing with incense as a child, to car- rying the sedan chairs of the gods or preparing household offerings as a teenager, to (for the men) taking a turn as a member of the temple management committee once one has married and had a child, to a position as a village elder after reaching fifty-five or sixty—along the way some also become spirit mediums or ritual specialists, opera stars or marionettists, temple accountants or masters of ceremonies. Some, like young to middle aged business leaders, may appear too busy to participate directly, but they are likely to contribute additional indi- vidual funds beyond the set per-capita amount that is collected by the temple committee prior to each ritual. As mentioned above, all these accounts are posted on red sheets of paper on the temple walls shortly after the ritual for all to check and confirm.<span class="s9">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The historical overview provided below emphasizes that each new</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">historical level of ritual form (early god cults, Buddhist and Daoist rites, spirit possession, ancestral worship, multi-village processions, Three in One self-cultivation and ritual practice, collective spirit medium group dance) interacted with earlier levels to create a complex and growing set of cultural and ritual resources and a range of techniques for the mobilization and management of village communities and the invoca- tion and application of cosmological forces. Rather than superseding, negating, or contradicting earlier layers of ritual forms, these different techniques of the performance of social and cosmological power con- tinued to build up new mixed forms and potentialities for local social and cultural change.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Throughout the history of the villages of Putian, we find evidence of local collective experimentation with new ritual traditions.

Others are inventive adaptations of state ritual forms and ideas. For example, experiments with lineage ideology and ritual form was an early feature of Xinghua society, beginning in the Song dynasty (Clark, 2007). Lineages spread widely in the Ming, but by the Qing the broader tendency was for the transformation of the lineage form from within by its merger with capitalist forces into a kind of contractual lineage, a sort of joint stock corporation (Zheng, 2001).<span class="s9">11 </span>Even while some lineages continued to grow in power, the overall trend in the Putian plains was towards the dispersal, or merging, of the lineage into territorial ritual groupings. The latter development was part of a general trend from kinship ties to territorial ties expressed in ritual alliances. The complexity of the interaction of many factors meant that cultural ritual innovations could occur unintentionally or as a process of trial and error, and yet spread rapidly across the entire evolving, open cultural system.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In order to comprehend just how lineage forms and temple alli-</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">ances could interact over time in Putian, it is necessary to examine the historical layers of contemporary ritual events in Putian. The histori- cal overview below begins with a description of the changing physi- cal environment due to the reclaiming of land from the sea and the establishment of several irrigation systems. Next the rise of Buddhist monastic estates and their rites for the dead is examined. This is fol- lowed by a discussion of the beginnings of lineage formation, early ancestral halls and ancestral worship in the late Song, and the spread of the lineage form in the early Ming. The historical overview then examines the mutation of early Ming <i>li </i>sub-cantons and their <i>shê </i><span class="s8">社 </span>altars of the soil and the harvest into the kernel of a new mode of local regional ritual alliances, centered in the temples of the popular gods. One can readily imagine the involvement of lineage leaders in such a process.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">We also suggest below that the rise of regional ritual alliances may have been the result of “ecological feedback” from an increasingly complex and interconnected irrigation system which enforced modes of collective cooperation from “irrigation-communities” drawing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_014.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">11 <span class="s7">Later lineages experimented with new forms of organization more closely resem- bling transnational joint stock corporations in which membership or “shares” in the lineage could be purchased regardless of kinship and the lineage could invest in adopted sons who could be sent overseas as a form of speculation.

The Single Whip tax reforms in the mid and late Ming, along with the pirate raids and inter-dynastic disturbances of the late Ming and early Qing, led to a downloading of responsibility over the maintenance of local infrastructure to local elites, many of whom would have been lineage leaders, who increas- ingly joined in the management of temples, regional ritual alliances, and higher order ritual territories as a base for the mobilization of human and physical resources necessary for system wide maintenance of the irrigation system. Whatever its origins, the constantly evolving network of ritual alliances of hundreds of village temples formed an unstable but expanding zone of relative local autonomy in the late Ming and the Qing. Even today one could argue that these networks establish zones of temporary, relative autonomy during the perfor- mance of rituals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Why Ritual?</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One might reasonably ask why ritual is the focus of these volumes, and in what ways it functions as the preferred site for the merging of politi- cal, economic, social and cultural forces in contemporary Fujian. The rituals discussed in this volume, and documented in the survey vol- ume, are all communal village celebrations. They include village and ritual alliance celebration held during Chinese New Years (especially the Lantern Festival) and other annual communal festivals such as the <i>Xiayuan Pudu </i>(Rite of Universal Deliverance of the Lower Prime) held in the Putian area on lunar 10/15, rather than on the more usual date of <i>Zhongyuan </i>(Middle Prime) on lunar 7/15. The birthdays of the gods which are celebrated communally occur throughout the year. Thus these volumes do not discuss individual or family based rites, and only occasional mention is made of lineage based ancestral rites (which are far less common in this area than celebrations of the gods).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The communal village rituals which are the focus of these vol- umes are an especially significant object of study because they mobi- lize the entire village community. Each member of the village has a part to play in the overall ritual event. Each household contributes a set small amount on a per capita basis to the temple committee. Wealthy individuals contribute substantial amounts to display their wealth and status and to reinvest in the community. As mentioned above, the temple committees and ritual alliances form a second gov-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 17</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ernment, responding more rapidly and effectively to local needs than the local government. The ritual events organized by the temple com- mittees are part of a long history of local self-management that can be traced over time. The techniques of management and mobilization were developed in many different institutions, including the lineage in its many forms, the schooling of village children for the imperial examination system, and the collective training of spirit mediums and altar associates. This ability to mobilize entire village populations into processions and celebrations has a deep relationship to the success of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in mobilizing village populations for dramatic struggle sessions in the early phases of the land reform movement, and throughout the processes of the collectivization of farms, the development of communes, and the factional battles of the Cultural Revolution. Ritual events are expressions of local cultural self-definition, which draw upon and creatively appropriate imperial or state symbols and ritual forms, mixing and combining them with local mediumistic and other ritual traditions. The last thirty years have shown the power of these processes of local self-expression, as homog- enous state-imposed cultural forms have been replaced by communal celebrations.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The successful staging and performance of a festival commemorat-</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ing the gods is the performance of local power. This is not only a symbolic expression of power, rather, the material activities involved in the gathering of funds, organization of tasks, preparations of food offerings and costumes, decorating of altars, and the composition of ritual documentation are themselves concrete workings of power and desire, including aesthetic desire, sensory desire for the stimula- tion and mixing of the senses in ritual events, and desire for fun and companionship and celebration of community. Rituals directly invest these desires into material expressions. The ritual events documented in these volumes involve the simultaneous performance of activities that trace several concentric circles or loopings of activity: 1) proces- sions that can last several days involving hundreds of villagers starting out from the village temples and then tracing the boundaries of their ritual territories and alliances; 2) visits to each household in the village by smaller processions of the gods carried in sedan chairs along with spirit mediums possessed by the gods, met with elaborate food offer- ings, incense, and fireworks; 3) complex rites performed in the temples by Daoist and other ritual specialists while opera, including necessarily ritual opera, is performed on stages facing the temple; 4) visits to the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">18 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">temple by individual worshippers bearing offerings, burning incense and spirit money, and setting off firecrackers, along with more formal visits from neighboring or allied villages, with processions of musi- cians and temple committee representatives; 5) musical performances by traditional ritual ensembles of <i>shiyin bayue </i><span class="s8">十音八樂 </span>(ten sounds (of string and wind instruments) and eight (percussion) instruments) or <i>dachui </i><span class="s8">大吹 </span>shawm ensembles in one corner of the temple court- yard; 6) competing performances in the courtyard of marionettes or puppets or marching bands or disco dancers or popular singers;</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">7) a corner of the courtyard is often set aside for cooking, as the entire scene is a setting for transformations of many kinds, in this case of food into energy and sensory stimulation. Such ritual events have often been viewed as an expression of other, more important deter- mining or underlying forces, such as social or religious values, or the working out of social conflicts. But it is important to examine ritual in itself as a material activity embodying and working local desires and local power.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Even from a more conventional notion of power (see the critique of such approaches in Geertz, 1980:122), the staging of rituals, including processions, possession by the gods, Daoist rites and opera perfor- mances, is a contest of wills with state authorities. While the latter now are usually content to assist with public security, the past few decades have involved endless struggles, negotiations and confrontations over the size and scale and route of the rituals and their processions. Cur- rently, a sort of steady-state phase has been achieved in the Putian plains, where processions do not seek to expand beyond traditional (meaning here Republican period) scope and scale (with some inter- esting exceptions).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">These ritual events do not only struggle for space with the state. They are also described in local terms as <i>yingshen saihui </i><span class="s8">迎 神 賽 會 </span>(com- petitive gatherings to attract the gods), in other words, holding compe- titions with neighboring villages and alliances to: 1) demonstrate their wealth and cohesiveness through setting off mountains of fireworks, inviting the best opera troupes, acquiring elaborate costumes for their processions, and throwing spectacular feasts for friends and outside invitees; 2) stake a claim over territory through processions tracing their boundaries, during which they often veer into the territory of neighboring alliances in a show of bravado; 3) show off their support from the gods by staging elaborate performances of parallel rites by different troupes of ritual specialists and by training a group of spirit</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 19</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">mediums who can transmit the intentions of the gods in dramatic trance sessions; 4) display their martial prowess and their strength of numbers in processions and through the crowds they attract to their celebrations and feasts; 5) demonstrate their relative status and senior- ity by claiming privileged positions in collective processions and by formally inviting and hosting representatives of neighboring villages to their festivals. Despite the competitive nature of these actions, there is considerable respect for maintaining the scale and order of the system of ritual alliances. Only within these systems do such assertions of status make sense.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Related Research</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">There is a glaring lack of surveys of temples and ritual activity in dif- ferent parts of China W.A. Grootaers (1948, republished in 1995) compiled three surveys of temples in northern China during the 1940s but since then there has been little systematic research of this nature on contemporary Chinese religion and local history. Sidney Gamble included some discussion of village temples in his socio-economic study of Dingxian (Gamble 1963, 1968), also conducted in the 1940s. The past few years have seen renewed publications on religion in North China. Jing Jun described the re-invention of localized Confu- cian ritual traditions in Gansu (Jing 1996). Thomas Dubois analyzed village level religion and sectarian ritual traditions in Northeast China (Dubois 2005). Stephen Jones documented local ritual traditions and ritual musical performance traditions in several areas of North China (Jones, 2007). Daniel Overmyer and Fan Lizhu (Ou Danian 2006–2007) edited reports on temple fairs and ritual activities in four counties of the North China plain, and Overmyer has summarized this fieldwork in an overview volume (Overmyer 2009). David Johnson examined a range of unique communal rituals performed in the past in Shanxi (Johnson, 2009).</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Over the past two decades, John Lagerwey, Yang Yanjie and Tam</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Wai-lun, et al., have edited a series of several hundred field reports in Chinese in over 30 volumes entitled <i>Kejia chuantong shehui congshu</i><span class="s8">客家傳統社會叢書 </span>(<i>Traditional Hakka Society Series</i>). This series covers village and town temple and lineage rituals in primarily Hakka regions of southwest Fujian, northeast Guangdong, and southern Jiangxi, as well as in non-Hakka regions of Guangdong and Fujian</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">(Lagerwey, et al., 1994–2009). These volumes provide extensive and very valuable information about lineages, temples, festivals, rituals and processions, and Daoist ritual traditions in the villages described. However, this project is explicitly described as an exercise in “salvage anthropology”, with the intention of recording the recollections about ritual life of elders in these communities before these cultural memo- ries are lost. Since these volumes primarily collect historical recollec- tions of village elders, they seldom provide specific historical dates. Thus it is sometimes difficult to assess whether the activities described continue to be practiced in the villages and towns mentioned, or when they ceased, or whether they have been revived. There is also little clear sense of the geographical criteria for the selection of sites, although recent volumes in the series select sites on the basis of economic con- siderations (marketing hierarchies) or political administrative factors (county seats and townships). These caveats aside, the series provides invaluable data, and recent monographs have become more focused on contemporary field reports.<span class="s9">12</span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A second important publication series dedicated to contemporary</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Chinese popular religion are the 120 volumes of the <i>Minsu quyi congshu</i><span class="s8">民俗曲藝叢書 </span>[<i>Studies in Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore</i>], edited by Wang Ch’iu-kuei, and published in Taipei by the Shih Ho Cheng Folk Culture Foundation (Wang, ed., 1993–). This series includes many detailed reports on local ritual activities in fifteen provinces of China. Overmyer (2000) provides summaries and critiques of many of the volumes in this series. The series includes field reports, collec- tions of primary sources, play scripts or ritual texts, monographs, and collections of research papers. One focus of the series has been on different regional forms of Mulian opera. Another focus has been on ritual drama, especially masked exorcistic <i>Nuo </i>drama <span class="s12">儺</span><span class="s8">戲</span>. Several individual volumes make an outstanding contribution to the study of Chinese ritual and drama.

This focus on spatial distribution of a wide range of socio-cultural forms is facilitated through the use of GIS (Geographic Information System) tools, which make it possible to map and analyze the distribution of particular cultural and geographic features across the entire area. This approach enables one to outline the contours and distribution of a local pantheon, distinct from that of other regions of China, and to present hypotheses on the evolution of this local pantheon over time. This emphasis on the importance of spatial location also leads to a new way of approaching local documents, including the writings of local literati, which should have important consequences for the field of Chinese studies. The essay by Zheng Zhenman translated in Part Two is an example of this approach to locally situated texts.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">This study builds upon earlier fieldwork conducted independently</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">by the authors that led to studies of the transformations of lineage formations in Ming and Qing Fujian (Zheng 2000), analysis of Dao- ist ritual and popular cults in the Minnan region (Dean 1998), and exploration of the ritual traditions of the Three in One in the Xinghua region (Dean 2003). Methodologically speaking, this book presents a model for studies of Chinese local history through its combination of a cultural geographical approach to a specific geographic area (incorpo- rating GIS technology), anthropological fieldwork (surveys, participant observation in rituals, and interviews), religious studies approaches to the study of liturgies, rituals, and iconography, and historical analysis of local documents (stelae, posted accounts, scriptures and liturgies, lineage genealogies, and mediumistic chants and talismans) discovered during the research.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">14 </span>A subsequent publication is planned in Chinese that will include posted temple ritual accounts, the texts of post 1949 stone inscriptions, and an analysis of the ritual economy of the region.

These <i>cun </i>are inde- pendent settlements, usually surrounded by rice-paddy fields or fruit trees. Villages range in population from several hundred to several thousand people. Some of the villages in the survey have expanded and merged with neighbouring villages, so that only locals know the boundaries of their village’s ritual territory. With the spread of roads, factories, and urban space, many villages have built three storey build- ings with shopfronts along the roads that pass nearby them. Some- times the buildings can be several rows deep, lining the main road. Most are concrete structures covered with white tiles or whitewashed. The landscape of Putian has been transformed by these roadside con- structions, so that there is a serious hardening of the transportation arteries underway, giving the impression of a spreading spiderweb of modern matchbox apartment blocks, interspersed with larger facto- ries. Leaving the roadways through doorways marked with the names of villages, one quickly re-enters rural space, although the villages are now a mix of modern concrete and brick structures, three, four or even six stories high, and older, large two story farmhouses built of pounded earthen walls, stone foundations, and wooden beams. The remaining older homes often have balconies and painted tiled decora- tive motifs on their facades.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Currently, throughout China, natural villages are governed by what are called <i>xingzheng cun </i><span class="s8">行政村 </span>Administrative Villages. These are collections of one to several villages, usually with a total population of around 2000–3000 people, that are administered by management committees made up of local officials, some elected, who make deci- sions about the uses of village lands, collect fees, and serve as represen- tatives of state policy at the village level. In the survey we indicate the adminstrative village to which each natural village belongs.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">From very earlier times, village communities in China were referred to as <i>li </i><span class="s8">里 </span>. This term was used in the Song for a much larger adminis- trative regions below the level of <i>xian </i><span class="s8">縣 </span>(county, or district), although it remained in use for natural villages as well. In the early years of the Ming dynasty, the term was redefined once again, this time to refer to re-grouped communities of 110 families, made up in theory of ten <i>jia </i><span class="s8">甲 </span>units of ten households each, with an additional ten households of community leaders, one for each <i>jia </i>unit. Each of these <i>li </i>was also</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">a ritual unit, with its own officially sanctioned <i>shejitan </i><span class="s8">社稷壇 </span>altar to the soil and the harvest, and its <i>litan </i><span class="s8">厲壇 </span>altar to the unrequited dead.<span class="s9">15 </span>Brook (1985) proposed naming the <i>li </i>administrative regions as “sub-cantons”. Putian county was divided in the early Ming into some thirty-three <i>li </i>sub-cantons. The Putian plains were divided into twenty two <i>li </i>units. These differed considerably in size, and were in part origi- nally based on population, with the city of Putian divided into three <i>li</i>, and the nearby surrounding villages gathered into several more <i>li </i>administrative regions. Some <i>li </i>were designed to follow the main lines of the evolving irrigation systems, as most villages were settled along the sides of the main irrigation channels. This led to some <i>li </i>becom- ing elongated in shape, as more land was reclaimed from the sea over time, and irrigation canals were extended into these reclaimed areas. Other <i>li </i>units covered quite large areas of sparsely populated hills and mountains, where villages relied on mountain streams for water, and raised fruit trees such as lychees, loquats, and pipa to supplement their incomes.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The <i>li </i>sub-cantons were further subdivided into <i>tu </i><span class="s8">圖 </span>local adminis- trative units, and the Putian plain in the early Ming was divided into just over 100 of these regional units. In the late Ming, in response to widespread major scale pirate invasions, a new form of administrative territorial division was instituted, called the <i>pu </i><span class="s8">舖. </span>In many parts of China, this term is used either for wards of a city or for offices of the imperial postal service, but in the Putian plain the term was extended to mean collections of villages with common policing and self-defense duties. These territorial administrative units were preserved to some degree through the Qing dynasty, although major changes were insti- tuted in local taxation and household registration. Although the <i>li </i>sub- cantons have now long been abandoned, they are still present in the minds of many villagers, as the different names of the <i>li </i>sub-cantons are still used in ritual documents. Thus each individual mentioned in a ritual document provides an address that lists his county, his li sub- canton, his village, his ritual territory ( <i>jing </i><span class="s8">境</span>), his temple and his altar to the earth god (<i>shêmiao </i><span class="s8">社廟</span>). Villager’s spatial identification com- bines territorial and administrative spaces from several different eras.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_018.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">15 </span>The <i>(Hongzhi) Chongkan Xinghua fuzhi</i>, j. 21 of 1503 includes full details of the prescribed rites of sacrifice at these altars (2007: 573–582).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 25</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In the late Qing (Daoguang period) and Republican period, govern- ments imposed a <i>baojia </i><span class="s8">保 甲 </span>mutual security territorial administrative system, and the post-1949 PRC government initiated a long series of changes to territorial administration, introducing units such as agri- cultural collectives and production brigades (often natural villages), communes, and then after 1979, a system of townships and admin- istrative villages. Changes continued over the past three decades, as cities like Putian were given broader jurisdiction over surrounding regions, and some towns in the Putian plains such as Hanjiang, were promoted to the level of an urban region.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Such changes reflect the fundamental transformation of the econ- omy of Putian plain, which went from being well over two-thirds agri- cultural in the late 1970s to over two-thirds light industrial by the year 2000. Tremendous economic growth on the order of 20% a year over two decades has transformed the landscape and the villages of the Putian plains. Putian city has tripled in size over the past three decades, leveling most of its lovely wooden buildings from the late Qing and Republican era, and swallowing up several nearby villages. The Hanjiang urban region has doubled in size, adding a large indus- trial zone filled with factories. A large percentage of these factories produce shoes, including running shoes, for export and for a grow- ing internal market. Many of these factories work on rotating shifts throughout the day, and employ armies of mostly young women from the villages of Putian. Virtually every village on the Putian plain has undergone extensive reconstruction, as wealthy villagers build five and six story homes out of concrete in place of traditional, spacious two story farmhouses, built of wood with walls made of packed earth. The demand for new housing has greatly expanded the size of many vil- lages, leading to a sharp decline in farmland.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Many villages along the coast have been bisected by new high speed</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">highways, or the tracks of new high speed trains. As all land ultimately belongs to the government, and is only leased long-term to the vil- lagers, land can be reclaimed by the government at any time. Com- pensation is always an issue. Charges of government corruption are common under these circumstances. For displaced villagers in areas absorbed by urban growth or regional infrastructure projects, an entire way of life has come to an end. Interestingly, village temples are often the last building left standing in a village that has been flat- tened, as protracted negotiations go on as to the costs of compensation and reconstruction, and the site for the rebuilding of the temple. Even</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the Communist Party and the local government can not easily ignore these centers of village power, and their connection to the powers of the cosmos. On the eastern side of Putian city in the new suburbs, older village temples have been rebuilt all in a row, surrounded by apartment blocks. To the north of the city, where several villages have been bulldozed to make way for gated communities of expensive apartment buildings, the temples have been relocated to the side of a nearby mountain. However, on the south side of Putian, near the former southern gate, temples still claim a space close to their original locations, and can be found in between new apartment projects.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">As will be seen below, the ritual alliances in this survey describe themselves using many different terms. These include the term <i>cun </i><span class="s8">村, </span>designating as we have seen a natural village (that is, an independent settlement surrounded by its own agricultural fields). Another term often found in the survey is <i>jing </i><span class="s8">境</span>, meaning a ritual territory with its own <i>shê </i><span class="s8">社 </span>altar and its own temples. Equally common is the term <i>shê</i><span class="s8">社</span>, meaning a ritual association with its own altar of the tutelary god. The term <i>xiang </i><span class="s8">鄉 </span>is usually equivalent to the term <i>cun </i><span class="s8">村</span>, but often designates smaller, more dispersed villages in rolling hills at the edges of the irrigation system. Finally, the term <i>jia </i><span class="s8">甲 </span>indicates ritual asso- ciations often linked to specific neighborhoods, not necessarily with their own independent <i>shê</i>-altar. This term can also be used to desig- nate natural villages or lineage sub-divisions as ritual associations.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The locally coined term <i>qijing </i><span class="s8">七 境 </span>(seven-fold alliance of ritual</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">territories) is the most common expression used to describe ritual alliances. Such alliances are made up of (usually) seven ritually inde- pendent natural villages, each having its own <i>jing </i><span class="s8">境 </span>(sacred ritual territory) containing a <i>shê </i>altar and a temple (often both together in one temple). These villages or ritual units celebrate common rituals and processions at a collectively owned and managed main temple. The term <i>qijing </i>is synonymous in the Putian plains with ritual alliance, but as will be seen, true seven-village <i>qijing </i>are a minority of the ritual alliances found by the survey. Some of the <i>qijing </i>we surveyed now include more than seven villages, but usually the additional villages branched off from other villages in the alliance and joined into the alliance without yet achieving independent ritual status. In a few cases, there are less than seven villages in a <i>qijing</i>, due to the rapid changes brought on by urbanization, or due to internal disputes within an alli- ance. The term <i>jing </i>can also designate ritual regions within a single</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 27</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">village, or be used to designate alliances with four, ten, or thirteen independent ritual units (in these cases, natural villages). We also find the term <i>pu </i><span class="s8">舖</span>, discussed above, used to describe the city ward ritual alliances inside of Hanjiang <span class="s8">涵江 </span>city, Huangshi <span class="s8">黃石 </span>and Hushi <span class="s8">笏石 </span>towns, and the police/self-defense alliances of some of their sur- rounding villages.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Of the 153 ritual alliances of the Putian plains, forty-five, or almost one third of the total, fit the criterion of being true <i>qijing </i><span class="s8">七境</span>, made up of seven ritually independent villages. Seventy-four ritual alliances are multiple-unit alliances with more or less than seven component units, as shown in Table 1 below. In this table, one can find the num- bers of alliances made up of between two to thirty-six <i>shê, jing, jia, cun, xiang, or pu</i>. Thus there is one multi-village alliance made up of two <i>jia</i>, three alliances consisting of three <i>jia</i>, and twelve alliances made up of three <i>cun</i>, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="1" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_019.png"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table 1: Table of ritual units within 119 multi-village alliances</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Units</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 3 4 5 6</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7 8 9</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10 13 14 15 18 24 36</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="1" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_020.png"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">shê 5 5 3 3 2 1 2 1</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">jing 1 45 1 1</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">jia 1 3 2 1 1 1</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">cun 12 5 5 3 1</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">xiang 2 2 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="1" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_021.png"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">pu 1</p><p style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Thirty-four ritual alliances on the Putian plain are in fact independent villages.

Many of the multi-village alliances on the Putian plains are referred to locally as <i>qijing </i>(sevenfold alliance), even when there are fewer villages or ritual units within the alliance.<span class="s9">16 </span>We can only speculate that this term may have originated in the practice within <i>weisuo </i><span class="s8">衛所 </span>(forts) of building temples in the center of the fortified walled town and at each of the four gates.

Additional temples inside the fort or outside the walls were often called <i>shang </i>or <i>xia miao </i><span class="s8">上下廟 </span>(upper and lower temples). Such a constellation of seven temples may have formed a matrix for concep- tions of the defensive powers of the ritual alliances.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Upon closer examination, the reader will find that many of the</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">ritual associations underlying these terms have to do with surname groups, lineages, and branches of lineages. A particular lineage or branch of a lineage may live together in a specific neighborhood (<i>jia</i>) and use this territorial association as a basis for participation in ritual alliances within a village. If this territorial association has established a <i>shê </i>altar the lineage may control the activities of that temple. In many cases, lineages have over time dispersed across a village, or into several nearby villages, and no longer associate on the basis of prox- imity and residence in a particular village neighborhood. Under these circumstances, the <i>shê</i>-temple or the <i>jia </i>ritual association may become a multi-surname association. In some cases, particular deities remain the focus of the dispersed lineage’s ritual activities. Often particular deities in a multi-deity large village temple are associated with spe- cific lineages or surname groups (including multiple surname groups). These groups take responsibility for the celebration of the god’s birth- days, or carry the god’s sedan chair in processions. Thus in the survey below the reader will often find that particular lineages take specific gods (or the same god on different days) on a procession around their neighborhoods or to neighborhood shrines or ancestral halls, even if</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_025.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">16 </span>The first usage of the term <i>qijing </i>is found in the <i>Chongkan Xinghua fuzhi</i>, origi- nally printed in 1503: juan 9 (p. 274 in the 2007 edition).

In some cases, these activities become the focus of a lineage reunion and rites of ancestral worship, under the watchful eyes of a local god (compare the practices described in the Fuzhou region by Szonyi (2002).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Even though the surname groups of the Xinghua region were amongst the first in China to experiment with the lineage form and to create new forms of ancestral worship already in the Song, village tem- ples currently far outnumber lineage halls in the villages surveyed.<span class="s9">17 </span>This by no means suggests that lineage relations are unimportant in the area. On the contrary, our historical survey below reveals how cru- cial lineages were to the reclaiming of land from the sea in the Putian area in the Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming periods. Song sources such as the <i>Puyang bishi </i>reveal that many lineages at the time were based within the walls of Putian city, although they usually also had exten- sive rural land holdings as well. This pattern would continue, with the simultaneous centripetal pull of the district capital and the centrifugal dispersal of each lineage as it expanded into newly reclaimed lands and villages, or divided into separate branches and dispersed across the Putian plain. The growing commercialization of the economy, already highly pronounced in Song Putian, led in the late Ming and Qing dynasty to new structural transformations of the lineage into something closer to a joint stock company, where membership could be purchased. These tendencies furthered the dispersal of lineages and favored the development of multi-surname villages. At the same time, however, many lineage leaders and their families built homes and ancestral halls inside Putian city. Thus when considering the continu- ing importance of lineage within ritual alliances one should bear in mind that the nature and functions of the lineage changed over time in this area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Main findings of the survey</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The irrigated Putian plain now covers an area of 464 sq. km. along the Xinghua Bay, to the east of Putian city. This plain covers just over ten percent of the Xinghua area as a whole (4060.4 sq. km.).

The Xinghua region is ringed by mountains and faces the sea. The Lai <span class="s8">瀨 </span>river runs along a narrow valley through Xianyou county from its multiple sources in the Dai- yun <span class="s8">戴雲 </span>mountain range of central Fujian. After crossing into Putian county, the Lai river is diverted into the Mulan <span class="s8">木蘭 </span>irrigation system just below Putian city. From this point it irrigates the southern and the northern Putian plain. The northern plain is also irrigated by the Yanshou <span class="s8">延壽 </span>river and the Qiulu <span class="s8">萩蘆 </span>river. The Qiulu river also provides water to the separate irrigation system of the Jiuliyang <span class="s8">九里洋 </span>area in the northeast corner of the Putian plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Nowadays, the Putian alluvial plain to the east of the city is divided</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">into nine townships: Chengjiao <span class="s8">城郊</span>, Xitianwei <span class="s8">西天尾</span>, Wutang <span class="s8">梧塘</span>, Hanjiang <span class="s8">涵江</span>, Jiangkou <span class="s8">江口</span>, Qiulu <span class="s8">萩蘆</span>, Quqiao <span class="s8">渠橋</span>, Huang- shi <span class="s8">黃石</span>, Beigao <span class="s8">北高</span>, and Hushi <span class="s8">笏石</span>, with a population of over 750, 000. Aside from Putian city, with over 110,000 people, the major commercial and population centers are Hanjiang city (population over 70,000), Huangshi town (over 50,000), and Jiangkou town (30,000).<span class="s9">18 </span>The majority of the population still resides in 724 villages scattered across the Putian plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">On average, we found the population of the 724 villages of the Putian to be over 1000 people (1020), with the population of some villages rising as high as 10000. Of course, there is no such thing as an average village, and what is far more important locally are the rela- tionships (historical, economic, political, and cultural) between larger villages and surrounding smaller ones. From the vantage point of each village, the questions to ask include whether this is a larger, locally dominant village with a long history, with one or more powerful lin- eages that produced many scholar-literati, or whether it is instead a smaller, dependent village, with mixed surnames, a shorter history,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_027.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">18 </span>Estimates drawn from the 2000 national census as reported in the <i>China 2000 County &amp; District Population Census Data Assemblies </i><a href="http://chinadataon/" class="a" target="_blank">found on </a>http://chinadataon line.org/member/county2000/, accessed 4/25/2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 31</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">and few if any scholar-literati in its past. The overall population of the 724 villages surveyed was 746,495.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The survey found over 100 different surname groups in these 724 villages; while the average village had between three and four sur- names, some villages had as many as fourteen surnames, and under a third were single surname villages. The survey also found that most villages had three or more temples (3.25), (while some villages had as many as eighteen temples, many of them had only one temple). These thousands of temples (2586) housed many thousands of god statues (10433) representing over 1200 different deities. There were 3966 god statues found in the Nanyang <span class="s8">南洋 </span>southern irrigated plain, 5229 in the Beiyang <span class="s8">北洋 </span>nothern irrigated plain, and 1238 in the Jiuliyang<span class="s8">九里洋 </span>irrigated plain. Village temples thus averaged four gods or more, but some temples house as many as thirty-five gods. The pres- ence of these gods, many of whom were worshipped on their birthdays in communal rituals, meant that there was a considerable amount of ritual activity in the villages throughout the year, in addition to major annual festivals. We were told that villagers in the Jiangkou area could attend rituals and watch operas 250 days out of the year by taking only a short walk to neighboring villages.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">We have identified and mapped 153 ritual alliances on the irrigated Putian plain. Mapping these boundaries raises difficult questions about representation, knowledge, and power. There are no physical markers of the boundaries of the ritual alliances. They are instead generated by repeated physical movements of the participants in ritual events—the boundaries are created and continually re-created by the routes taken by processions of the gods as they trace out first the physical limits of their own village, and then move around the boundaries of the rit- ual alliance to which they belong. Hopefully readers will see the lines drawn on the maps below as lines in motion, vectors of power con- tinually being re-inscribed and always susceptible to change. Through engaging in this survey, we have drawn ourselves into these maps, moving from village to village and re-confirming (and representing) the alliances and their relations to other features of physical space including the irrigation system and the newer roadways that generate new connections and new vectors for the expansion of village space. These ritual alliances were drawn from the ground up, rather than being imposed by the state in the form of an administrative spatial hierarchy. Mapping the ritual alliances enables a comparison of these different kinds of space.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">32 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Due to the densely populated nature of the plain, the proximity to the sea and coastal trade, and the presence of a rich transportation network with hundreds of kilometers of irrigation canals along with many roads and bridges, the region is not necessarily a clear illus- tration of an economic space divided up according to a hierarchy of markets. On the other hand, the town centers of the eight townships into which the plain has been divided administratively since 1980 are fairly evenly distributed, and would have provided daily markets for villagers who could easily reach them (or the city of Putian) within a relatively short time. The current expansion of the transportation system has reduced the layers of the market hierarchy, making daily markets in Putian, Hanjiang, or Huangshi markets readily available on a daily basis. However, market hierarchies do not explain the distribu- tion of the ritual alliances.<span class="s9">19</span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The overlap between the administrative <i>li </i>sub-cantons of Song, Yuan,</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Ming and Qing times and the economic spatiality of the plains can be better understood when the <i>li </i>sub-canton boundaries are seen to have followed segments of the irrigation canals. As these channels, or the lands watered by their secondary or tertiary canals, were extended fur- ther into newly reclaimed land from the sea, the sub-cantons stretched out as well to incorporate newly established villages, paddy fields, and their tax revenues. As will be argued further below, the ritual alliances developed for the most part within the boundaries of the sub-can- tons, which were also ritual spaces imposed by the early Ming court. The ritual alliances also developed in close connection to physical seg- ments of the irrigation system, whose maintenance required collective collaboration between neighboring villages which can be seen to have formed their own irrigation communities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Arrangement of entries in the  survey</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The survey in Volume Two is arranged by ritual alliance and by the vil- lages within each alliance in relation to their location along the major irrigation systems of the Putian plain, rather than in terms of the cur- rent Chinese administrative spatial hierarchy.

A brief historical introduction to each ritual alliance will allow the reader to consider the long historical processes of the reclaiming of land from the Xinghua Bay, the establishment of new villages for growing popu- lations, and the environmental aspects of the crucial supply of fresh water within the irrigation system to villages, rice-paddies, vegetable plots and orchards.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The main irrigation systems are the Southern irrigated plain (the Mulan irrigation system), the Northern irrigated plain (made up of the Mulan Weir <span class="s8">木蘭陂</span>, the Yanshou Weir <span class="s8">延壽陂</span>, and the Taiping Weir <span class="s8">太平陂 </span>irrigation systems), and the Nan’an Weir <span class="s8">南安陂 </span>irriga- tion system of the Jiuliyang area around Jiangkou township on the northeastern edge of the irrigated plain. Most of these ancient weirs are still intact, although they have been repeatedly repaired, and con- tinue to serve as low bridges over rivers. The segments of the irrigation system were divided up by the boundaries of the <i>li </i>sub-cantons of the Song, Ming and Qing period, which are no longer part of con- temporary administrative space, but which retain importance in terms of the ritual spaces of the irrigated plains. Generally speaking, the <i>li </i>sub-canton boundaries closely follow the path of the main canals and secondary channels of the irrigation systems. Moreover, the ritual alli- ances also take shape along subsections of the irrigation system, as can be seen by careful examination of the maps of each ritual alliance in the <i>Survey</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The 153 ritual alliances presented in turn in the survey are com- posed of 724 natural villages. Each ritual alliance is first located in relation to the main canal(s) or secondary channel(s) of the irrigation system that provides its water. Next, information on the late Ming and Qing <i>pu </i>(police/self defense unit) to which the villages of the ritual alliance belonged is provided. The boundaries of these <i>pu </i>units tend to be smaller than, and occasionally cross over, the ritual alliance bound- aries.

Some villages will have disappeared or changed name over time, but the general trend is for older villages to reach a maximum size after which nearby settlements are established and new villages divide off. As additional land was reclaimed from the Xinghua bay nearby, this provided more possibilities for the establishment of new settlements, often within view of the founding settlements. Gener- ally speaking, it is possible, when standing in any village in the Putian plain, to see three or four villages distributed around that village. The villages are on average less than half a kilometer apart. By consult- ing the maps of the ritual alliances accompanying the village data, the reader will be able to visualize the historical evolution of each ritual alliance.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Information on prominent lineages within the ritual alliances is next</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">provided.

Memorial archways erected in honor of particular lineages are detailed. This information will enable readers to sense the depth and distribution of elite scholar-literati across the irrigated plain.

A natural village is defined by its physical boundaries (fields sur- rounding a continuous settlement). The entries begin with a descrip- tion of each village settlement which first identifies the Administrative Village bureaucratic unit to which each natural village belongs (note that several natural villages are often jointly managed by one Admin- istrative Village but some very large natural villages have been divided into several Administrative Villages. The average population size man- aged  by  a  single  Administrative  Village  committee  is  around  2000 people). The population of the village is then given, along with notes on the local temple ritual system and its main principles of organiza- tion (by neighborhood or by surname group). A second section lists the principal surname groups of the village, with some information on lineage branches and ancestral halls, and on local points of origin of different lineages. The third section lists the temples of the village along with their main gods and their secondary gods placed on side altars or inside halls of the temple. The fourth section outlines villages rituals. These are divided into the rituals of the <i>Yuanxiao </i><span class="s8">元宵 </span>(first full moon) festival (sometimes including the <i>toufu </i><span class="s8">頭福 </span>(first days of good fortune) celebrations in the early 2nd lunar month), and the birthday celebrations of the feast days of the gods worshipped in the village temples.

Twelve teachers spent that summer visiting two or three villages a day in nine different townships (Jiangkou, Hanjiang, Wutang, Xitianwei, Chengjiao, Quqiao, Huang- shi, Huating <span class="s8">華亭</span>, Nanri <span class="s8">南日 </span>and Pinghai <span class="s8">平海</span>).<span class="s9">22 </span>They gathered</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_031.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;">22 <span class="s7">A subsequent survey was conducted in the summer of 1995 by teachers at the Meizhou Technical College in Fengting covers an additional 450 villages in seven</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">36 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">information on several hundred villages. These findings were typed up and cross checked through repeated visits by the authors between 1994 and 2006. As we traveled through the irrigated plain, we found that the irrigation system often stretched past township boundaries. We thus extended our survey to the north into Qiulu <span class="s8">萩蘆 </span>township, to the south into Hushi and Lingchuan <span class="s8">靈川 </span>townships, and in the southeast to Beigao <span class="s8">北高 </span>township. As we refined our survey and revisited sites, we were able to break down administrative village clusters into natu- ral villages. Our ultimate objective was to identify independent ritual units. This was complicated by the fact that most villages divide up the organization of ritual activities by neighborhoods.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Maps of the Putian area were gathered from several sources. These</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">included PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) military maps from the 1960s with a 1:50,000 scale, as well as the non geo-referenced maps and lists in the <i>Putian diminglu </i>(<i>List of toponyms of Putian</i>, Putian: 1980), along with city maps of Putian and Xianyou from the 1980’s at a higher level of resolution. Village locations were first identified on the basis of the PLA maps, which served as our underlying base maps for the project. All these maps were digitized, and combined, and then linked to satellite images of the region. Village locations were confirmed on the basis of comparing the maps, the satellite images, and our field observations. Over several summers, Prof. Zheng and I revisited each village twice, and in some cases three or four times, to verify and add to the data. During these visits, we built up a large collection of over 20,000 digital images of temple, god statues, murals, and posted temple accounts. We have published the pre-1949 stone inscriptions separately, and include references to their locations in the survey (Dean and Zheng, 1995).</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The data from the surveys, including the images, has been entered</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">into a series of databases and linked to a digital map of the region using a GIS (geographical information system).<span class="s9">23 </span>This GIS system</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_032.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">townships of Xianyou (Fengting, Jiaowei, Gaiwei, Bangtou, Chengdong, and Duwei), as well as the island of Nanridao and Pinghai in Putian county. Several of the Xianyou townships are situated along the upper reaches of the Lai River (also known as the Mulan river). These materials will require extensive cross-checking before they can be verified and used to compare with data from the Putian plains.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">23 <span class="s7">The PLA maps were digitized into raster files, and subsequently vectorized to allow for various kinds of geographical analysis.

This system can display in map form any of the features listed in the database for each and all villages. We have also developed historical GIS maps to chart the historical evolution of the irrigated plain, the evolution of the irrigation system over time, the distribution of the lineages (sur- name groups), the cults of the local gods, the 153 ritual alliances that the villages have formed from the Ming onwards, and the historical distribution of scholar literati over the Song and Ming, amongst other features (see below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Methodological implications</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This survey innovates by attempting to avoid the limitations of the single village study by examining all the villages in a given geographi- cally defined region. Of course, this study lacks the depth of the sin- gle village study, but hopefully makes up for this deficiency to some degree by unearthing a wider range of forms of village organization as seen through their annual rituals. Examining the entire range of vil- lages enables us to explore the full set of discernible interrelationships between territorial and lineage based social and ritual units. Surveying all of the village temples in the area enables us to determine the com- position and parameters of the local pantheon, and to begin to analyze the historic layers of this pantheon. Indeed, the survey volume could be seen as a tool for such kinds of analysis.<span class="s9">24</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">Patterns that emerge from the GIS mapping of survey data can be</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">used to test historical hypotheses.

Using digital elevation data from the USGS, we created a 3D image of the Putian bay over which the LANDSAT satellite image was draped, allowing the viewer to get a better sense of the lay of the land. As information became more complex, and greater querying capacities were needed to discover the correlations between different kinds of information, it became necessary to switch from a system connecting EXCEL files to MAPINFO software to a system connecting an ACCESS database to ARCGIS 9 mapping software. Subsequently, In order to include large quantities of images (which do not work well within ACCESS databases), and to put the data onto a website and eventually make it available without copyright protected software to interested users, we developed a MYSQL database linked with Mapserver software.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">24 <span class="s7">See the discussion of the different layers of the cult of the earth god below.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">38 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">will demonstrate, we mix historical sources with survey data to gener- ate hypotheses about the multiple origins of the ritual alliances now covering the Putian plain. We examine cases of the mutation of early Ming <i>shê </i>altars into regional ritual alliances in the mid-Ming, and also examine other alliances that formed later, or which appear to have formed on the basis of their proximity along a stretch of the irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Another example of the uses of GIS mapping concerns our discov- ery of quite discrete local sub-cultures within the irrigated plain. For example, many villages in the northeastern Jiuliyang plain, especially in Jiangkou (but also beyond the Jiuliyang plain in parts of Wutang, Xitianwei and Hanjiang) carry on a local tradition of the collective training of spirit mediums. These mediums and their altar associates (called <i>tanban </i><span class="s8">壇班</span>) perform group exorcistic line dances in this area. South of Jiangkou, along the coast of the Xinghua Bay past Hanjiang, many villages maintain a tradition of spirit medium contests known locally as <i>caihua </i><span class="s8">採花 </span>(lit. “plucking flowers”), that is, standing bare- chested in the shooting sparks of a massive Roman candle to show the power of the god. Both these traditions are absent in the southern irrigated plain, where mediums are mostly “self-selected”, and engage most commonly in spirit writing and individual trance. When we viewed the distribution of the more extravagant forms of spirit pos- session sites in relation to the distribution of sites of villages which had produced scholar literati who had passed higher levels of the imperial examinations, becoming <i>jinshi </i>and <i>juren </i>in the Song and the Ming, we noticed that the latter were primarily clustered in the southern irri- gated plain, and in scattered locations in the western edge and older parts of the northern plain, whereas the <i>tanban </i>altar associations and <i>caihua </i>medium networks were mostly clustered in the areas lacking literati. Thus one can hypothesize that the higher concentration of scholar-literati in the southern plain worked against the elaboration of distinctive local traditions of spirit medium performance found in the northeast corner of the plain.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">Using GIS mapping, one can unearth many suggestive correlations in distributions of different cultural features across the plain.

This suggests that the unruly natures of these gods</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">introduction: the survey and its main findings 39</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">appealed to poorer communities rather than to villages with established scholar-literati lineages (Shahar and Weller 1996).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Another example of the power and possibility of the GIS approach is the way it allows us to examine the impact of the early Qing coastal evacuations on the villages within ten kilometers of the sea (see <i>Map 27: The Qing Coastal Evacuation</i>, below). The ban was designed to contain pirate activity and prevent any local collaboration. Most of these villages were abandoned and then re-claimed and re-populated after the ban was lifted some twenty years later. Villages “beyond the limit ( <i>jiewai </i><span class="s8">界外</span>)” tend to have many more surname groups and many more temples, including temples of so called “secret religions”, as compared with the relatively undisturbed <i>jienei </i><span class="s8">界內 </span>(within the borders) villages. The <i>jiewai </i>village tend to have multiple village tem- ples and even several Three in One temples (and multiple varieties of lay Buddhist temples) within a single village, indicating that these temples provided networking opportunities for communities whose established lineages had been disrupted. This is only one aspect of the spread of the Three in One movements across Putian and Xianyou that can be explored using GIS tools. It must be said, however, that the amount of data provided by a GIS linked survey of this nature does not make it easy to draw generalizations. Nonetheless, by comparing different distributions of features (gods, surnames, dates of celebra- tions, population density, proximity to towns and cities) and historical layers (changing ecological features, administrative regions, and local alliances), one can examine unexpected correlations and generate end- less new questions about the region one is studying.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">A cultural geographic approach to a region, especially a coastal region like the irrigated Putian plain, also requires one to be open to broader trans-national flows of ideas, peoples, products, images, and technologies from Southeast Asia and the West. Thus we are atten- tive to the impact of Overseas Chinese and Christian communities on the ritual networks of Putian. A local perspective also enables one to examine the history of imperial institutional reforms from the point of view of local appropriations, transformations and mutations of these institutions into emerging networks of local society.<span class="s9">25 </span>A survey of all the village temples in the irrigated plain led to the discovery of many new local historical documents, and makes it interesting to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_034.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">25 </span>See the discussion of new approaches to the cultural geography of China in Carolyn Cartier, “Origins and Evolution of a Geographical Idea: The Macroregion in China”, <i>Modern China </i>28.1 (2002): 79–142.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">40 chapter one</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">read these documents in terms of their locational significance. Visit- ing the temples of these villages and meeting many excited, courteous, proud, knowledgeable, sincere and dedicated worshippers led us to consider the history of local ritual from the perspective of the villagers, rather than the elites. Examining the intricate and beautiful temples they have built, one is deeply impressed by the degree of refinement within village culture and its many modes of expression (learned and eloquent poetic couplets, captivating murals, intricate carvings, elusive divinatory  poetry,  imposing  architecture,  carefully  cultivated  plants and flowers, cultured temple keepers, devout patrons). Participating in many boisterous, complex, occasionally solemn but usually highly ludic ritual events of these village temples leads one to reflect on these events as the expression of a highly literate, deeply cultured society that is extraordinarily self-aware, good-humored, and creative.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER TWO</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">DEFINITIONS OF RELIGION IN  CHINA<span class="s9">1</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Some of the early pioneers of Chinese ethnography and anthropology produced subtle and nuanced ethnographic accounts of Han Chinese communities in the 1930’s and 1940’s which covered ritual aspects of communal life. After 1949, Soviet style models of ethnographic minor- ity studies were imposed and carried out under the auspices of the National Minorities Institute and its linked system of training colleges for minority cadres. In this mode of ethnography, “religion” is defined in a functionalist fashion as a fundamental, if reactionary, aspect of minority culture. This mode of analysis was not however applied to Han Chinese society, which was judged to have been largely secular- ized by the Chinese revolution and by the revolutionary processes of modernization underway since before the beginning of the 20th century. Chinese ethnography of “national minorities” in the 1950’s and early 1960’s was mostly engaged in researching, and to a certain extent “fixing” the religious beliefs and ritual practices of a number of “minority peoples”. At the same time, one of the world’s largest social surveys was underway across China as part of the land reform move- ment, which assigned each family to a class rank while also assess- ing the holdings of lineage trusts, monasteries and temples across the country. This incredible archive has yet to be fully accessed, but it promises to eventually provide extensive insights into many aspects of Chinese society and culture in the 20th century.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">For several decades after 1949, anthropologists conducted research</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">on Chinese culture in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. In 1974, Freedman proclaimed the unity of Chinese religion “as a sys- tem”.

The term was later adapted in the nineteenth century by scholars in Meiji Japan to translate another foreign conception, that is, the Western notion of “religion”. This re-defined phrase was soon taken up, along with a host of newly coined modern neologisms, or re- defined expressions, by late imperial and Republican period Chinese writers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">42 chapter two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">work of J.J. DeGroot in Batavia and in Xiamen, as shown in <i>The Reli- gious System of China </i>(1892–1910) as well as the theoretical writings of Marcel Granet in Paris, as exemplified by <i>The Religion of the Chinese People </i>(1922).</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">DeGroot and Granet have pointed the way to an understanding of how in modern times the vast hierarchised society of China might be seen to display a single underlying religion taking many guises. (Freedman, 1974: 34).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The concept of a system of Chinese religion developed by these anthro- pologists was a structural-functionalist one. There was great empha- sis placed on the timeless sphere of religion/culture within Chinese society—this notion of the inseparability or near equivalence of reli- gion with culture was furthered by notions of religion as a cultural system developed by Geertz (1973). We will return below to the prob- lematic nature of this early anthropological discovery of “the unity of Chinese religion”. The close connection between these static and uni- fied concepts of religion and/as culture in anthropology with colonial- ist and Orientalist modes of knowledge production was pointed out by a number of critical anthropologists, including Fabian (2002) and Asad (1993). This mode of post-colonial critique, along with objective changes in the conditions of anthropological research, led to a critical reflexive crisis of representation within anthropology as a whole (Clif- ford and Markus 1986).</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The influence of these critical movements within anthropology took</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">a rather long time to impact China anthropology. One important response was the articulation of calls for an indigenous “native anthro- pology”, which sought the development of theoretical paradigms from within Chinese experience, rather than merely applying anthropologi- cal concepts elaborated in Africa and elsewhere to the Chinese case, or generalizing findings from one place (Taiwan) to all of China (Chen 1987; Murray and Hong, 2005).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Feuchtwang (2001) had long argued for the double (official vs. popular), if not multiple and potential contradictory dimensions of Chinese ritual practice (local gods as simultaneously protective and demonic). He argued for local decenterings of power within dis- crete traditions of “contested authority claims” and “historical refer- ences”. This perspective still had difficulty disentangling itself from a model of an internally contested but still unified cultural system (Bell 1989). Feuchtwang and Wang Mingming have gone on to conduct a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">definitions of religion in china 43</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">series of comparative studies of local politics and place-making (what Feuchtwang refers to as the establishment of “minor sovereignties”) in Taiwanese and in Chinese communities (Feuchtwang and Wang 2001; Feuchtwang 2004). Wang Mingming’s (1995) own work on popular uses of space within Quanzhou raised the question of local forms of cultural resistance to hegemonic projects of national unity.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Weller’s work (1987) initially worked within a framework of cul- tural unity while attempting to bring out the disunities and well as the unities of Chinese religion and culture. His later work on alter- nate civilities (Weller 1999) rejects the imposition of Western models of modernization or civil society and imagines a different trajectory for local communal ritual traditions and emergent modernist religious movements in new forms of construction of the social and the national unique to Chinese societies. In general, his work can be read to move beyond a notion of the systemic unity of Chinese religion or culture, and implies a fragmented, multidimensional China, or the coexistence of multiple Chinese cultures.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Chun (2000) attacked the root of Freedman’s notion of the unity of Chinese culture and religion through his deconstruction of the sacred cow of the lineage form in his study of Chinese village property rela- tions in Hong Kong. He also makes the important point that member- ship in the <i>jia </i><span class="s12">家 </span>(family) is a ritual role first, and a biological kinship role only secondarily.<span class="s9">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Anthropology in China itself has focused primarily on questions of urbanization and the modernization of the peasant way of life. These aspects of developmental anthropology were provoked by the incred- ible speed of hyper-development in China, which coincided with the re-establishment of anthropology as an academic discipline in China in the early 1980’s. Some Chinese anthropologists worked to translate, introduce and apply a broader range of socio-cultural anthropologi- cal approaches in the 1990’s. Still, the bulk of the work in China had an understandable focus on the applied anthropology of development. There is a striking absence of cultural anthropological research on local communal ritual traditions of the Han Chinese.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_036.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">2 <span class="s7">In addition, Chun’s (2001) examination of the limits of the concept of diaspora in the Southeast Asian context raises critical perspectives on emerging claims to an alternative modernity within neo-Confucian (and neo-liberal) Overseas Chinese busi- ness networks—a subject to which we will return below.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">44 chapter two</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Within the newly cross-fertilizing fields of socio-cultural history and anthropology a number of new perspectives emerged on local ritual practices in China. Duara (1988) introduced the concept of a cultural nexus of power of traditional Chinese society in the Shandong area. Duara noted many of the elements of the cultural nexus of power in the area he studied (lineages, temples, irrigation maintenance groups, crop-watching associations), but he did not trace the historical evolu- tion of these elements. Instead, he implied that this cultural nexus was doomed to unravel under the pressure of the modern nation state. Another group of scholars who sought to combine anthropological approaches with historical research were David Faure and Helen Siu, who worked in Hong Kong, the New Territories, and the Pearl River delta of Guangdong (Faure and Siu, 1995; Siu 1989; Faure 1986; 2007). In Guangdong, they were joined in their research by Liu Zhiwei <span class="s12">劉 志 偉 </span>(Liu 1995; 1997), a student of Liang Fangzhong <span class="s12">梁 方 仲 </span>of Zhongshan University, and Chen Chunsheng <span class="s12">陳 春 聲 </span>(Zheng and Chen 2003). In Xiamen, the students of Fu Yiling <span class="s12">傅 衣 凌 </span>of Xiamen University, including Zheng Zhenman <span class="s12">鄭 振 滿 </span>, continued Fu’s emphasis on the collection and study of local historical materials, and broadened their investigations to include local ritual traditions in addition to socio- economic questions (Zheng, 2001).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This kind of local or regional history has had to defend itself against claims of irrelevance or of its inability to speak to larger themes of national history. Such demands for national, homogenous historical narrative were directly challenged in Duara’s <i>Rescuing History from the Nation </i>(Duara, 1995). Clearly, powerful nationalistic and institutional forces continue to demand the unification of historical narratives, but these  new  schools  of  local  history,  with  their  methodological  links between history and anthropology, have worked productively with a new focus on the lives of common people based on local histori- cal documents gathered during fieldwork in local communities. The Huanan school of local history is engaged in several internal debates, with Faure and Liu (Ke and Liu 2000; Faure 2007) recently proposing models of cultural integration and identification with the state, while the authors (Zheng Zhenman (2001; 2003) and Kenneth Dean (1998)) emphasize instead processes of local cultural mediation, experimen- tation, and hybridization, the spread of elite ritual techniques into different local communities, and the local appropriations of those tech- niques and symbols for very different, local purposes. Perhaps because</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">definitions of religion in china 45</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of these debates, a significant challenge to nationalist historiography has emerged in these studies.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Zheng’s work on the <i>Family-Lineage Organization and Social Change in Ming and Qing Fujian </i>(2001) also demonstrated that the Chinese lineage was a highly malleable form, which could go so far as to transform into a trans-national joint-stock corporation in which unrelated individuals could buy shares. This model explodes the ear- lier A–Z continuum of lineage forms proposed as modifications of the Freedman model of the Chinese lineage (Freedman 1964). We will see below one example of this kind of “super-lineage” linking Putian with Southeast Asia.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">If anthropology has had a fairly hard time establishing itself as an academic discipline in China, the same is also true of religious studies (Yang 2004). Within the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, religious studies ranks very high, just below Marxist Leninist thought. But this was originally because of the importance of analyzing ideological for- mations that were by definition alienated and potentially reactionary. In order to merge theory with practice, the implementation of policy emerging from this critical analysis of religion was the purview of the Bureau of Religious Affairs. There are still relatively few programs in religious studies in China. The earliest ones (Sichuan, Renda and Nanjing) were established in the 1980s. In the past fifteen years there has been an exponential growth of this academic field, involving the translation of many overviews and monographs of Western religious studies, but there are still very few empirical studies of contemporary Chinese ritual traditions.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Within Western religious studies, a recent movement has carried</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">out a critical reflection on the ideology of religious studies, and inter- rogated the processes of the invention of “world religions” and the study of comparative religions (McCutcheon 1997; Dubuisson 2003, Fitzgerald 2000, Masuzawa 2005). This critical movement questions the universalization of the notion of religiosity, which they traced back to Western theology. Some of these critics suggest instead a more self- conscious sociology of religion, based on paradigmatic changes to the field introduced by Stark and others who talk in terms of a pragmatics of religion as a set of rational choices within differing ritual market- places (Stark and Finke, 2000). An extended sociology of compara- tive religion may not however completely escape the critique of the founding notions of the field as a whole. Within anthropology, Asad</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">46 chapter two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">(1993) also called for the rejection of the term “religion” in place of the study of specific ritual traditions and disciplinary practices. In his subsequent work he has also urged the exploration of the impact of modernization theory, notions of secularization, and the institution- alization of Western definitions of religion on non Western societies (Asad 2003).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Western studies of Chinese religion have also foundered over ques- tions of defining the field of study. While Buddhist studies has a place in many departments of religion in North America and Europe, Daoist studies positions are extremely rare. Most religious studies programs are prepared to introduce religious dimensions of Confucianism, but many universities delegate Confucian studies to philosophy or East Asian Studies. But all the more evident for its entire absence within departments of religion is the realm of Chinese popular religion, or if one prefers the term, local communal religion. Following Asad, we may wish to call these practices local ritual traditions—the ensemble of which in any particular region would be an object of study. If Chinese religion is a unity, as claimed by Freedman, it has yet to become an object of systematic research. If it is instead a vast array of different ritual traditions, some of considerable longevity and complexity, all intertwining in different ways in different places, it is perhaps under- standable why few universities have dared to approach the study of such a complex range of phenomena. Neglecting to do so unfortu- nately means that a vast realm of human experience goes unstudied.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Within China, the institutionalization of a particular definition</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of religion drawn from Marxism over the past fifty years has led to many unintended consequences. This definition insists that each reli- gion must have a distinct religious organization, a religious leadership, religious doctrines and beliefs, and religious practices reflecting these doctrines. In 1982, Document 19, “The Basic Viewpoint and Policy on the Religious Question during Our County’s Socialist Period.” man- dated: “respect for and promotion of the freedom of religious belief.” This reaffirmed earlier laws protecting freedom of religious belief issued in 1949 and in the first Chinese constitution of 1954. As was the case with these earlier laws, Document 19 limited the freedom to believe to five major religions, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism. Article 36 of Document 19 limited state protec- tion to “normal” religious activities, without further definition of this term. In 1991, Document 6, “Circular on Some Problems Concerning the Further Improvement of Work on Religion,” mandated that every</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">definitions of religion in china 47</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">religious organization had to register with the authorities. Any unreg- istered group would by definition be illegal. New regulations were included on the internal organization of these groups covering issues such as personnel and financial accounting. In 1994, new regulations were issued by State Council on procedures for registration. In 1999 the State reasserted its power to distinguish orthodox from heterodox beliefs, and to classify heterodox religious groups such as the Falun- gong as illegal cults. Then on March 1, 2005, the State Council issued a new set of “Regulations on Religious Affairs”, which is primarily devoted to bureaucratic issues of registration, internal organization of religious groups, and official supervision by state agencies. The Regula- tions no longer include any mention of religious belief, but they main- tain the ambiguous language about “normal religious activity”.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">One earlier, but representative, formulation of the limits of normal</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">religious activity was provided in a nationally circulated note from the Zhejiang Provincial CCP Committee’s Party Rectification Office in 1986:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">In his speech at the National Conference of Party Delegates, Comrade Deng Xiaoping seriously pointed out: “In recent years production has gone up, but the pernicious influence of capitalism and feudalism has not been reduced to a minimum. Instead, some evil things that had long been extinct after liberation have come to life again.” This issue warrants our close attention. Some time ago, due to laxities in ideological and politi- cal work, feudal superstitions and patriarchal activities gained ground in some localities in our province, particularly in some rural areas, seriously poisoning the minds of the masses, particularly the younger generation, and affecting the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Some Party members and cadres also joined in the activities. Effective measures should be taken in line with Party rectification in order to resolutely curb and rectify this unhealthy trend. It should be made clear that the “normal religious activities” protected under the Chinese Constitution refer to religious ceremonies of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Christianity performed in religious places in accordance with their respective traditions and customs of religious activities conducted by religious followers in their own homes. These include prostrating oneself before the image of the Buddha, reciting scriptures, burning joss sticks, going to church, saying prayers, expounding Buddhist sutras, giving ser- mons, hearing Mass, receiving baptisms, being initiated into monkhood or nunhood, fasting, celebrating religious festivals, performing last rites, and conducting funeral services. Indiscriminate construction of temples without the approval of the Department concerned and feudal supersti- tious activities exceeding the limits prescribed by the religious policy must be stopped. Building clan temples, drawing genealogical charts,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">48 chapter two</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">joining persons of different ancestors to make them bear the same fam- ily name, and performing rites in honor of the ancestors are feudal, patriarchal activities, impermissible under our Socialist System. Invok- ing immortals to exorcise evil spirits, praying for rain, divining by the eight trigrams, telling fortunes by analyzing the component parts of Chi- nese characters, and practicing physiognomy and geomancy are feudal superstitious activities which should be resolutely banned. All activities which seriously infringe on the interests of the State and jeopardize the lives and property of the people must be resolutely suppressed (March 1, 1986, <i>Guangming ribao</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Fortunately, official attitudes towards local religion in southeast China have become more open, and there have been interesting recent efforts to reach new understandings of local religious movements there. However, in many parts of central China, local religion is still poorly understood even by officials in charge of its supervision.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">These kinds of definitions of religion, as they have been adapted in official policy in China, do not closely correspond with the range of ritual practices found in local communities across China. Instead, they cleave contemporary practice into pieces, with some aspects con- sidered acceptable and others not (for example, spirit possession and ancestor worship). This is especially clear when state officials attempt to apply such a definition and its associated policies and institutions to the field of popular local ritual traditions. There one finds no clearly distinct religious organization, religious leader, religious doctrine, or “religious” practices—in the sense of practices reflecting specifically articulated doctrinal beliefs. The ubiquity of spirit possession in this realm of ritual activity suggests an openness to revelation and alter- ity quite distinct from the “religions of the book”. The importance of lineage, whether within the context of ancestral worship or as a key element underlying multiple modes of local organization of popular god worship, indicates the continuity of the fundamental ritual role of the <i>jia </i>(family) in everyday life.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">One way that this problem has been dealt with in the past fifteen</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">years in China is for scholars and some government officials to cat- egorize popular ritual practices as “folk customs”, thereby making them more acceptable but also making them recuperable for projects of nationalism under the broader umbrella of Chinese culture. Here too there is a long legacy of nationalist plans for the improvement of culture, the quality of the people, and in the extreme, but still common version, the transmission of modernist culture to people who are said to have no culture. One extraordinary result of the spread of these</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">definitions of religion in china 49</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">discourses is that one often hears villagers engaged in complex ritual activities state that they have no culture (<span class="s12">沒有文化</span>), and that they are practicing feudal superstition (<span class="s12">封建迷信</span>), and isn’t their feudal superstitious activity magnificent? Clearly, the terms of the prevailing discourse are undergoing intense strain.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One aspect of these definitional or conceptual problems must be discussed here, as it sets the stage for the survey below. Within Chinese academic and policy circles, the study of “Chinese popular religion” has traditionally meant the study of religious led peasant rebellion—that is to say millenarian cults and secret societies, as seen in the monumental study by Ma Xisha and Hang Bingfang entitled <i>Zhongguo minjian zongjiaoshi (A History of Chinese Popular Religion) </i>(1992). In effect, the field of Chinese popular religion has been consti- tuted as the study of heterodoxy and superstition (<i>mixin </i><span class="s12">迷信</span>)—that is to say actions defined as illegal and heretical. Scholars such as Over- myer (1976; 1999), Seiwert (2003), and ter Haar (1992) have labored to document the limitations of this scholarly perspective by demonstrat- ing: 1) that the vast majority of popular religious movements across Chinese history have been peaceable and not involved in rebellion, and 2) that those that did rebel more often than not were driven to do so by the actions of the state. Ter Haar (1992) has been particularly clear in documenting the impact of pejorative labels and unexamined presuppositions in this historical process. Well known developments in the late 1990’s have however only exacerbated this trend of Chinese scholarship, as can be seen by the proliferation of publications on his- torical secret societies and a new literature on comparative approaches to cults (in the current negative sense of the term). Of course, many Chinese scholars have attempted in response to develop a more com- prehensive and inclusive, not to say harmonious, approach to religious studies.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In some ways, these trends are a continuation of the dismissive atti-</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">tudes of earlier Chinese elites towards local ritual traditions. In this, the Confucian elite was to some extent aided by higher level Bud- dhist monks and Daoist masters who sought court patronage or the support of landed gentry and local officials. At court, these groups often maintained a distance from local ritual traditions.<span class="s9">3 </span>But even</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_037.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">3 <span class="s7">The exception being those ritual specialists who were brought to court specifically due to their links to local ritual traditions. This was especially the case with Daoist ritual masters.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">50 chapter two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Confucian literati had to maintain a relationship with their own vil- lage temples, and mid and lower level Buddhist monks and Daoist masters were deeply involved in local ritual traditions. Most likely, it was the close connection between Celestial Master Daoism and local communities across China (especially in the south) that led the Qing court to become suspicious and to decrease and eventually deny court patronage to this branch of Daoism. But local communities contin- ued to sponsor Daoist rites, providing the economic support necessary for the preservation and expansion of the many local ritual forms of Daoism, which evolved independently in relation to local communal ritual traditions. Under PRC models of the state and the citizenry, the new theory and practice of religion led to far more invasive and sys- tematic forms of control than the sporadic attacks of the late imperial state. These were different kinds of state paranoia. For the imperium, the project was to extend imperial cosmological power through ritual means and through education and emulation ( <i>jiaohua </i><span class="s12">教化</span>) to each community and family, but in fact the ritual agents of the emperor encountered a remarkably diverse field of local cosmological powers and ritual specialists, challenging their efforts to impose a continu- ous model of cosmological power. The totalizing and individualizing demands of the modern-state form created different demands for an enlightenment style, dialectical struggle between the forces of rational- ity and progress and the mysteriously resistant powers of what state agents could only conceive of as “feudal superstition”. Thus the seem- ing continuities in approach to popular ritual practices of the imperial state and that of the Nationalist and PRC governments belies a serious and significant change in definitions and tactics related to the rise of a modern nation-state with new bio-political powers.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In early 20th century Western scholarship, Daoism was treated as</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the degeneration of an ancient and noble philosophic movement, or at best as a form of personal magic with little connection to communal life (Weber, 1968). Only after the “discovery” of the ongoing Daoist ritual tradition in Taiwan by Schipper (1974) and Saso (1978, see also Strickmann 1980) in the 1960s was there a gradual rethinking of the complex interconnections of Daoism with local ritual traditions. As research into different Daoist ritual traditions across China has slowly proceeded over the past twenty-five years, a somewhat clearer picture of the multiplicity of liturgical frameworks within distinct mixes of localized Daoist ritual traditions interacting with evolving local ritual traditions with different local pantheons has emerged. These local tra-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">definitions of religion in china 51</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ditions, and their appropriations of the elite ritual traditions of Con- fucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, defy easy generalization into a unified system of Chinese religion. They demonstrate an exuberant multiplicity. Underlying this multiplicity are manifold forms of com- plex local organization.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In terms of sheer numbers, this is a massive phenomenon, and it always has been one, even if ignored by both traditional and modern scholarship. Of course, one’s perceptions of China are much affected by what one sees. The hyper-development of Chinese economy is visible in every city and town and many villages across the country. Nonetheless, the gap between rich and poor continues to grow at an alarming pace. The experiential gap between urban and rural everyday life expands equally quickly, despite the spread of modern telecom- munications. In many rural areas the revival of ritual practices appears to be taking hold, especially in those areas close enough to expanding urban centers but far enough away or sophisticated enough (due to historical reasons) to preserve some local cultural autonomy. Due to the nature of the issue, there will never be an objective count of the people involved in these local practices, although the number is sure to be in the hundreds of millions.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Inside Chinese academic and religious policy circles, there has been</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">a clear recognition of the advance of secularization of the urban popu- lation along with a greater openness towards the activities of the offi- cial religions. The local offices of the Bureau of Religious Affairs now include minority and ethnic affairs under their purview, which would seem to indicate some pragmatic acknowledgement of the broader cultural dimensions of local ritual practice amongst Han Chinese as well as among the “national minorities”. Unfortunately, or perhaps predictably, this has led to a bureaucratic bean-counting approach, where local temples are now often officially registered as “Daoist” in order to fall under some acceptable official classification.<span class="s9">4 </span>This allows for closer supervision and regulation of financial and other aspects of local ritual organization. This is a process that repeats in some respects the developments on Taiwan over the past fifty years in official policy towards  “popular  religion”.

The concept of a “local religion” moves beyond the limits of the policy of the five official religions and shows greater awareness of the complex lived experience on the ground. This breakthrough is a mutual accomplishment as the Three in One movement has petitioned for this kind of official recog- nition for decades.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One way to explore these issues is to start from the ground up, by examining contemporary ritual life and organization. We suggest an alternative approach to local ritual traditions as the intensification of everyday life, rather than the establishment of a separate, sacred space or a private domain of individualized worship. Arguing that ritual is an intensification of the everyday is not simply to emphasize the highly ritual foundations of everyday social interaction, but also to point to the space of play, pleasure, and friendship (Lefebvre 1991) within the everyday that are intensified in ritual events. Of course, Lefebvre has been concerned to document the overcoding of these spaces by capi- talist relations. What is especially intriguing about the contemporary ritual events in Fujian is their ability to fold in the forces of capitalism and the forces of nationalism, to speed up and reflect back on these forces, and to still preserve the power to generate new worlds of expe- rience for their local communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In Fujian and along the South China coast, the history of local ritual</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">traditions is linked to broader themes in local/transnational history, to the coastal trade routes of the Asian oceans. But before looking further afield it would be worthwhile to look into the past, in order to seek to understand the accumulation of the many layers of ritual form that have contributed to the village rituals of contemporary China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER THREE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Map 1: Satellite Map of the Putian Plain <span class="p">(color plates) is a satellite image taken in 2002 (Landsat7) of the Putian plain, showing the ring of mountains around the plain and the patchwork of irrigation canals.

In ancient times, the Putian plain was originally under 30 meters of sea water, as can be seen in <i>Map 5: Ancient Shoreline of the Putian Plain</i>. Extensive land reclamation and the establishment of the first major irrigation canals resulted in the marked expansion of the Putian plain, as seen in <i>Map 7: Song shoreline of the Putian Plain.

The former peoples were called <i>Danmin </i><span class="s8">疍民 </span>by the Han Chinese, while the latter were called the <i>She</i><span class="s8">畲</span>. Surviving groups of both these early settlers can still be found in Fujian. Early Chinese sources refer to the peoples of this area as the hundred Yue <span class="s8">越 </span>peoples.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">Early in the Han, Han Chinese explorers began to move into South- east China. Some of these figures attained legendary status, such as the nine He <span class="s8">何 </span>brothers, who are said to have moved from Jiangxi into Xianyou in the Han Yuanshou <span class="s8">元狩 </span>period (122–117 BCE). Their legend is recounted in the <i>Xianxizhi </i><span class="s8">仙溪志 </span>of 1257, one of the earli- est local gazetteers. After studying Daoist arts with Liu An, compiler of the <i>Huainanzi </i><span class="s8">淮南子</span>, they moved into Fujian, eventually settling at the Jiulihu <span class="s8">九鯉湖 </span>(Nine Carp Lake), above a waterfall. There they proceeded to refine elixirs of immortality. According to an eighth century inscription, they succeeded at this task, became immortals, and transformed into nine carp spirits (hence the name of the lake). They were worshipped as protector deities of the region. To this day, people sleep in the caverns near the lake, known as the Jiulihu <span class="s8">九鯉湖 </span>(Nine Carp Lake), to receive visits from the gods in their dreams. A manual  of  dream  interpretation  has  been  written  to  help  explicate their dream visions.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Shortly after this period, Han Chinese armies attacked the Kingdom of Min Yue. According to some local sources, Yu Shan <span class="s8">余 善 </span>, the King of Min-Yue, fled to the mountains of Putian and Xianyou, where he built a fortress to resist the Han (<i>Putian xianzhi</i>, 1994: 8). After his defeat, the Putian area fell under the ostensible rule of the Kuaiji <span class="s8">會 稽 </span>Commandery of Zhejiang. Han Chinese military colonies and settlers began to slowly move into the mountain valleys and coastal regions of Fujian, where they set up a military colony near the Wuyi Mountains in northern Fujian. Complete colonization of Fujian, including the Putian area, would take several hundred years (Bielenstein 1959).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Efforts to establish an administrative center in Putian were made in 568 and in 589, but these were abandoned. Finally, in the early Tang (Wude 6), in 623, Putian city was made into a district capital. In the Tang, the site would have been very close to the ancient shoreline of the Xinghua Bay. <i>Map 6: Tang Shoreline of the Putian Plain </i>shows the locations of several reservoirs which provided irrigation to the early settlements along the thin stretches of the Putian plain. Hanjiang is said to have been founded in 627 at the site of a sluice-gate empty- ing into the sea (the original name was Hantou <span class="s8">涵頭</span>).

The Ming or Qing novella, <i>Ping Min Shibadong </i><span class="s8">平閩十八洞 </span>(<i>The Pacification of the Eighteen Caverns of Fujian</i>), tells the story of the successful victory of Yang Wenguang, one of the famous Yang Family Generals, over barbarian tribes in Fujian in the Song dynasty. Most scholars agree this tale is in fact based on the exploits of Chen Yuanguang (d. 708), a Tang general, and his father Chen Zheng <span class="s8">陳政 </span>(d. 677). Chen Zheng was sent with an army of 3600 troops to the southern part of Fujian in 669 to subdue indigenous peoples resisting Han settlement of the area. Chen Yuanguang took over the campaign after his father’s death and fought until his death in battle in 708. His son brought the campaign to a successful close in 715.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In the novella, the Han Chinese hero defeats local inhabitants gar- risoned in eighteen “cavern-fortress dwellings” across Fujian. Two of these are said to be located in the Putian area, namely the Zhenshan- dong <span class="s8">鎮山洞 </span>(Mountain Fortress Cavern) led by He Tao <span class="s8">河濤 </span>(lit. River wave) and his sworn brother Li Jinrong <span class="s8">李金容 </span>(golden mien), and the Huangcaodong <span class="s8">黃草洞 </span>(Yellow Grass Cavern) at the base of Hugong Mountain <span class="s8">壺公山</span>, a volcanic cone-shaped mountain which dominates the view from every point in the Putian plain, led by one Du Yin <span class="s8">杜引</span>. Local people living on Hugong Mountain claim that the “Cavern” in the myth is in fact a secluded valley with a lake, set deep inside the southern foothills of Hugong Mountain. According to the myth, once killed by the Chinese general, the leaders of the first cavern-fortress reverted back into a black snake and a golden carp respectively, while the leader of the Mt. Hogong Cavern turned into an earthworm.

After her victory, the soldiers of the Divine Mother of the Heavenly River bow down before the Goddess Chen Jinggu and join her entourage. In this way, she absorbs the powers of her defeated enemies, and turns their demonic energy into her own supernatural power. The play concludes by merging into a ritual for young chil- dren passing through the many gates of adversity (<i>guoguan </i><span class="s8">過關</span>). In another ritual play about the goddesses’ powers over smallpox and childhood measles, Chen Jinggu defeats a massive black python and subdues a Tiger goddess, whose powers over smallpox are put to good use. This process of absorbing the powers of those she overcomes is also seen in her principal myth, recorded in the <i>Linshui Pingyaozhuan</i><span class="s8">臨水平妖傳 </span><i>(Record of the Pacification of Demons by the Lady by the Side of the Water)</i>. In this myth, Chen Jinggu becomes the goddess most closely associated with the fertility of Fujian, even as she battles an evil White Snake to the death. As young women, Chen Jinggu had refused to marry, preferring instead to join a sisterhood learning magi- cal arts from a ritual master on Mount Lu. Later she relents to her parents’ wishes, and marries. She is then called upon to perform an arduous rain-making ceremony. Prior to praying for rain to save the harvest, she has to abort her own fetus, but she places it in safekeeping under a magical protective spell, and in her mother’s care. The spell is broken by her enemy, the White Snake, who tricks her mother into revealing the whereabouts of the fetus. The Snake then devours the fetus. At this point, Chen Jinggu begins to hemorrhage, but is saved by her ritual master. She recovers, and pursues the White Snake, which she ultimately defeats in a battle to the death. The snake is contained in a crevice beneath her throne in her temple in Gutian, north of Fuzhou. After her death, she continues to protect women in childbirth and children suffering from smallpox and measles.<span class="s9">3</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_041.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;">3 <span class="s7">See the fascinating structural symbolic analysis of the legend of the goddess, her temple, and the lives of her female mediums in Brigitte Baptandier, </span><span class="s6">The Lady of Lin-</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 57</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">In the Putian plain, Chen Jinggu is widely worshipped (see <i>Map 34: Distribution of temples dedicated to Chen Jinggu </i>below).

On the jiao, see Schafer 1980:25–27. Clark points out in a recent paper the link between the <i>jiao </i>and the crocodile in Minnan sources. He draws as well on Han Yu’s famous missive to the crocodiles of Chaozhou to argue that these accounts are metaphors of the struggle between Han Chinese and indigenous civilizations, and that the death of Wu Xing implies the inevitable intermixture of these cultures and their sources of cosmic force.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">58 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">in the villages of Xizhu <span class="s8">西 洙 </span>and Xitou <span class="s8">溪 頭 </span>some kilometers away. Even more intriguing is the fact that his sister, the goddess Wushi shengfei <span class="s8">吳 氏 聖 妃 </span>, is worshipped even more widely than Wu Xing <span class="s8">吳 興 </span>, in dozens of villages on the northwest edge of the Putian plain. This goddess is but one of many such supernatural females who seem to have dominated the magical universe of the early inhabitants of the Putian plains, and perhaps of the indigenous inhabitants of the region as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Many other gods and goddesses found in the region appear to have been involved in similar struggle against local indigenous powers, often represented in serpentine or demonic form. The character for Min (Fujian) features a worm, or a serpent, inside a doorway. Zhang- gong shengjun <span class="s8">張 公 聖 君 </span>, the wild-haired, barefoot Daoist exorcist, clutches a snake in one hand. He too is said to have plunged into a pool to kill a dragon. Sanping zushi <span class="s8">三 坪 祖 師 </span>, the Buddhist monk of the Zhangzhou <span class="s8">漳 州 </span>region, has snakes coiled around his throne. The Buddhist monk of the Youzhengyan <span class="s8">楢 貞 巖 </span>Cliffside Monastery in Xianyou is said to have turned a huge and dangerous python into stone.<span class="s9">6 </span>Qingshui zushi <span class="s8">清 水 祖 師 </span>, the black faced monk of Penglai <span class="s8">蓬 萊 </span>, Anxi <span class="s8">安 溪 </span>, had his complexion smoked black in a magical battle with indigenous spirits, whom he defeated and enlisted as his gatekeepers. Over an over again, these motifs are played out in the story of the early spiritual conquest of Fujian by Han Chinese Buddhist and Daoist thau- maturges. The Han colonization of Fujian appears to have advanced on two fronts. On the one hand Buddhist and Daoist ritual specialists competed with, and perhaps absorbed elements of, local ritual tradi- tions, in a magical conquest of the region. On the other hand, military leaders put down armed uprisings, established military colonies, and paved the way for complete Chinese administration, with registered populations paying taxes in grain and performing corvée labor for the representatives of the imperium.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Shê leaders were still active in the Xinghua area into the late Ming,</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">as in the case of Lei Wu <span class="s8">雷五</span>, who participated in a revolt in 1588, as recorded in a stone inscription preserved in the Xianyou Confucian temple. But later evidence of Shê communities in the Putian area is dif- ficult to find.

Larger communities of Shê can however still be found in northeast Fujian.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In addition to the Shê peoples of mountainous Putian, the coastal areas were no doubt inhabited by peoples known to the Chinese as <i>Danmin</i>, often referred to as boat people. Dan communities can still be found in the Fuzhou Nantai area (see Szonyi 2002). A Song scholar- literati surnamed Lin remarked that Meizhou island, now the site of the massive Tianhou Temple (Goddess of Heaven) Temple dedicated to a local woman Mazu <span class="s8">媽祖 </span>(Lin Moniang), was an idyllic island whose few inhabitants were illiterate, and that it would be a great loca- tion to build a get-away study. This would imply that Mazu may have been an illiterate <i>Danmin </i>shamaness herself (Zheng Zhenman 1996). Only later, after she had received official canonization from the court, would Lin lineage genealogies claim a place for her as one of their own glorious ancestors.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Cai Xiang <span class="s8">蔡襄 </span>(1012–1067), a local son of Xinghua and a renowned Prime Minister in the Song dynasty famously remarked that “the peo- ple of Min (Fujian) worship demons and delight in ghosts” in an early record of the shamanistic cults of the region. Some of the most vehe- ment of the fundamentalist Neo-Confucian followers of Zhu Xi <span class="s8">朱熹 </span>(1130–1200)  who  attacked  so-called  heterodox  cults,  such  as  Chen Chun <span class="s8">陳淳 </span>(1153–1217), were from Fujian. Perhaps their insistence on establishing such strict boundaries against heterodoxy should be seen as evidence of the persistence of hybrid cultural forms, combin- ing Han Chinese traditions of spirit possession with more unfamiliar acts of possession by indigenous spirits and cosmic forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">The first recorded Buddhist monastery in Putian was the Golden Immortal Monastery, bequeathed in 589 by the Zheng brothers, who converted their Hushan shutang <span class="s8">湖山書堂 </span>study hall, built in 558. This monastery was later renamed the Guanghuasi <span class="s8">廣化寺</span>, which is the largest Buddhist monastery in Putian to this day. Many more Buddhist monasteries would be built during the reign of Wang Shen- zhi <span class="s8">王審知 </span>(862–925) Emperor of Min. The Song scholar Li Junfu<span class="s8">李俊甫 </span>(1217 <i>jinshi</i>) stated in his <i>Puyang bishi </i><span class="s8">莆陽比事 </span>(<i>Putian Mis- cellany</i>) that: “Wang Yanjun <span class="s8">王延鈞 </span>of the Min upheld the Buddhist law, and in a single year ordained 20,000 monks.

At its peak, the Nanshan Guanghuasi <span class="s8">南山廣化寺 </span>had over ten monastic estates, with over 120 <i>an </i>(smaller shrines or nunneries). It is estimated that Buddhist monastic estates controlled over one third of the land in Putian in the early Song (Chikusa 1982). These estates played a crucial role in building up local infrastructure, including irrigation systems, roads, and bridges.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The first Daoist temple, the Xuanmiaoguan <span class="s12">玄</span><span class="s8">妙觀</span>, was built in 628</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">CE.<span class="s9">8 </span>The earliest private Confucian school was the Chengzhu shutang<span class="s8">澄渚書堂 </span>built by Lin Yun <span class="s8">林蘊 </span>in the Dali period (766–779). Gov- ernment Confucian schools were first built in 772. With these cultural institutions in place, alongside military colonies and administrative and taxation centers, large scale Han Chinese cultural imperialism, referred to as <i>jiaohua </i><span class="s8">教化 </span>(transformation through education), got underway. A protective wall of just over two <i>li </i>was built around the administrative offices of Putian in 983. A larger city wall of seven <i>li </i>with five gates was only built in 1121. The walls were expanded to over ten <i>li </i>in 1430. They stood over twenty feet high, were partially encircled by a moat, and withstood all but two sieges, those of the Mongol armies in 1277, and those of the pirate armies in 1562.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As Benedict Anderson (2006) pointed out, this was not a modern- nation state but an archaic empire, in which power worked in very different ways. Primarily centered in ritual sites of contact with cos- mological forces, such as the Altar to Heaven, power worked as a cen- ter of attraction through the imitation of ritual acts. Ritual forms were developed that could be imitated through participation in scaled down versions at lower levels throughout the empire. Scaled down versions of similar rites were imposed on the localities, in a system of ritualized hierarchical encompassment. There are however limits to encompass- ment, acknowledged by this system. Because such imperial borders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_045.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">8 </span>As noted below, Daoist ritual masters of the southern Zhengyi (Orthodox Unity) tradition worked mainly out of their home altars, rather than being based in temples. However, some Daoist masters were stationed in grand temples in Putian City. In addi- tion to the Xuanmiaoguan, the Wanshougong was built in the Yuan Yanyou period (1314–1320) by a member of the Fang lineage, on the stipulation that his descendants should be the Daoist abbots of the temple. Daoists were also active in the City God temple of Putian, built in Ming Hongwu 3 (1370). Daoist directors of this temple were active in renovation projects in Wanli 3 (1575), Wanli 19 (1591) and again in Wanli 34 (1606). Daoist ritual masters were again in charge of repairs in Kangxi 30 (1691). For further details see the Qianlong (<i>Putian xianzhi</i>), j. 4.46a, b., p. 168.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 61</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">are porous, and because the Others’ attractions to and involvement in the ritual system are by definition sporadic or strategic, power only works as a center of attraction, not as an all-encompassing totality. This mode of power does not equate ‘being Chinese’ with a modern, air-tight notion of “cultural identity”. Such a mode of power assumes the existence of a broad continuum stretching from indigenous prac- tices and rites to more acceptable “Han” ritual activity. There were no lack of later efforts to impose a more systematic version of a continu- ous cosmology of imperial <i>magical </i>power stretching from the Altar of Heaven to the local altars of the City God temple and the Lishetan<span class="s8">里社壇 </span>Altars of the Soil and Grain, and on down to all households ostensibly practicing Zhu Xi’s <i>Family Rituals</i>. However, these ideo- logical attempts at systematization of the source, nature, and reach of imperial cosmic power encountered a complex and continuously shift- ing ground of local cosmic forces expressed in a variety of ritual forms, as well as internal diversity and challenges at the discursive level and at the level of ritual practice provided by different kinds of Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian theorists and practitioners.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Secondly, Anderson notes that power was maintained through hier- ogamies, (cosmically inflected) marriage alliances at the court amongst the aristocracy. With the fall of the aristocratic, oligarchic order of the Tang dynasty and the Song expansion of Han control into the south, many local lineages would compete to enter into the court circles of power through intermarriage. However, marriage strategies between local elites remained an important medium for the circulating and reaffirming of power at the local level (Clark, 2007: ch. 4). Nonethe- less, even here the potential for hybrid mixes was great, as many indig- enous inhabitants must have married into Han Chinese families in Putian. The earliest Han Chinese settlers on the narrow Putian plain most likely arrived in groups of kin and many dependents. Their first task was to reclaim stretches of mud-flats from the sea, building small dikes and creating a series of small settlements along the coast. Many of these areas are still named after the kinship groups that reclaimed them from the sea, as can be seen in the survey or in Zheng Zhen- man’s essay (Part Two below). Only after several contiguous pieces of land had been reclaimed from the sea would state authorities attempt to construct a sea-dike to link them together and protect them from floods or storms.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">62 chapter three</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Land reclamation and irrigation</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The first era of the reclamation of the Putian plains lasted from the Tang through the Five Dynasties, and was characterized by the dig- ging of reservoirs for irrigation of the narrow coastal plain (the loca- tion of these reservoirs can be seen on <i>Map 6: Tang Shorelines of the Putian Plain</i>). These included early efforts of Wu Xing to construct the Yanshou Weir north of Putian City in the 780’s, mentioned above. In Tang Yuanhe 8 (813) a military colony was established on the south- ern side of the Xinghua bay under the Surveillance Commissioner Pei Ceyuan <span class="s8">裴 次 元 </span>, who dug the Guoqing Reservoir for the Han Chinese troops and settlers of that region (Qianlong <i>Putian xianzhi</i>, j.3.32a). The reservoir has now become the <span class="s8">國 清 塘 </span>Guoqing Lake.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The second era in the reclaiming of the Putian plain was during the Song. At that time a series of weirs were built along the rivers flowing into the Xinghua Bay to divert water into a system of major irrigation channels and canals which were also dug is this period. From the Yuan to the mid-Ming, these irrigation systems were filled in by digging of secondary and tertiary canals and the expansion and continual con- struction of sea dikes. Through a long process of the construction of irrigation and the reclamation of land from the sea, three large and relatively independent irrigation systems were developed. These are the: 1) Nanyang Southern irrigated plain with the Mulan Weir <span class="s8">木蘭陂 </span>(1068–1083) at its origin; 2) the Beiyang Northern irrigated plain<span class="s8">北洋水利系统 </span>with the Yanshou Weir <span class="s8">延壽陂 </span>(780–783), the Taiping Weir <span class="s8">太平陂</span>(1056–1063) and the Shihua Weir <span class="s8">使華陂 </span>at its multiple starting points; and the 3) Jiuliyang <span class="s8">九里洋水利系统 </span>with the Nanan Weir <span class="s8">南安陂 </span>(977) at its origin.<span class="s9">9 </span>Maps of the main features of these irrigation systems can be seen below.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The shape and distribution of villages in the Putian coastal area is</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">closely linked to the development of the irrigation systems.

Because large scale irrigation had not been developed, these settlements were widely scattered, and there must have been many boat people living off fishing along the coast.<span class="s9">10 </span>Over the Song and Yuan dynasties, following the gradual expansion of the great irrigation systems, settlements spread into the center of the plain and along the coast. These newly established settlements usually had corresponding irrigation canals and protective dikes, therefore many of them have the words <i>tang </i>(<span class="s8">塘 </span>reservoir), <i>dai </i>(<span class="s8">埭 </span>dike), or <i>dun </i>(<span class="s8">墩 </span>mound) as part of their names. During the Ming and Qing, new mudflats (<i>daitian </i><span class="s8">埭田</span>) were constantly being reclaimed from the sea beyond the seawalls, so that we find the expressions “first dike”, “second dike” and “third dike” frequently used. The number of coastal villages in these newly reclaimed zones continued to expand. By the late Qing, the Mulan irrigation system of the Southern plain provided water to 102 villages, while the Yanshou irrigation system of the Northern plain serviced 172 villages, the Taiping irrigation system watered twenty-eight vil- lages, and the Shihua weir system irrigated twenty-nine villages.<span class="s9">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The extraordinary success of these efforts to reclaim land from the sea and to irrigate this land for agriculture can be seen in <i>Map 4: The Song Shoreline of the Putian Plain, and Map 5: Ming Qing Shoreline of the Putian Plain </i>(see color plates). The last several hundred years have seen a much slower pace of change. Erosion and silting have extended the mud-flats along the coast, and in a few areas these have been reclaimed for agriculture, but the system as a whole reached the limits of possible physical expansion by the late Ming. From that time on, the emphasis was more on maintenance of the system than on land reclamation.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Yanshou Weir and its main irrigation canals were established in the Northern Irrigated Plain in the mid Tang (780–783). At this point, several large lineage groups each began separately to reclaim patches of land from the sea, establishing various independent reservoirs and dikes, such as the Lindai (Lin dike) <span class="s8">林埭</span>, the Yetang (Ye reservoir)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_047.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">10 </span>According to the (Hongzhi) <i>Chongkan Xinghua fuzhi </i><span class="s11">重 刊 興 化 府 志 </span>(2007:313) in the Ming there were three Hebosuo <span class="s11">河 泊 所 </span>(Fishery Tax Stations) established in Putian, which each year took in over 3,500 piculs of “fishery rice tax” <span class="s11">鱼 課 米 </span>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">11 </span>See Chen Chiyang <span class="s11">陳池</span><span class="s16">養</span>, <i>Putian shuilizhi (Putian irrigation gazetteer </i><span class="s11">莆田水利志</span>, j. 2. <i>Beitang </i>(Weirs and reservoirs) <span class="s11">陂塘</span>, published in Qing Guangxu 1 (1875, reprinted in 1974).

At that time, several Buddhist monastic estates also were active in reclaiming stretches of land, such as the Guohuan monastic estate </span>國懽院田<span class="p">, the Cishou monastic estate</span>慈壽院田<span class="p">, and the Shangsheng monastic estate </span>上生院田<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">The Mulan weir was completed in the Southern Irrigated plain between 1064–1083. After two unsuccessful efforts, the first by Lady Qian Siniang<span class="s8">錢四娘 </span>(who died in the process in 1064), the second some years later by Lin Congshi <span class="s8">林從世</span>, one Li Hong, also known as Li Zhangzhe <span class="s8">李長者</span>, succeeded in constructing the weir from 1077 to 1083. Both Lady Qian and Li Hong are worshipped in the southern irrigated plain (see <i>Maps 38: Distribution of temples dedicated to Li Zhangzhe and Map 39: Distribution of temples dedicated to Lady Qian Siniang. </i>At that time much of the labor and funding, as well as the land, came from the so- called “Fourteen Surnames” <span class="s8">十四大家</span>— including the three Yu <span class="s8">三余 </span>surname groups or lineage branches, the seven Zhu<span class="s8">七朱</span>, the Lin <span class="s8">林</span>, Chen <span class="s8">陳</span>, Wu <span class="s8">ª </span>and the Gu <span class="s12">顾</span>.

At first the Taiping irrigation system was first managed by the “Eight Great Surnames”, but later it was taken over by the Bud- dhist monks of Nangshan Monastery. The date of construction of the Shihua Weir in the Northern irrigated plain is unclear, but from the early Ming the irrigation system was under the control of the Fang lineage. The Nanan Weir was constructed in 977, but in the Southern Song and the Ming it was controlled in succession by the Fang, the Huang and the Wang lineages, who managed its reconstruction. The coastal areas of the Jiuliyang irrigated plain were also reclaimed by various lineages independently, as can be seen by the names of vil- lages and reclaimed land in that region such as Wu mound <span class="s8">ª墩</span>, You mound <span class="s8">游墩</span>, Chen mound <span class="s8">陳墩</span>, Ou dike <span class="s12">歐</span><span class="s8">埭</span>, He dike <span class="s8">何埭</span>, Zhuo dike <span class="s8">卓埭</span>, and Eastern Cai dike <span class="s8">東蔡埭</span>.<span class="s9">12</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The historical  evolution  of  irrigation  systems,  the  environmental constraints on settlements, and the modes of lineage and religious organization all had determining influences on the construction of the space of activity of local Putian society.

These systems are described in more detail in Volume Two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Buddhist monastic estates and the rise of lineages</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As mentioned above, Buddhist monasteries played an important role in the management of some of the early irrigation systems and in the reclamation of the land of the Putian plain. Buddhist monasteries were built at an escalating rate from the sixth century through the Tang, and especially during the Min Empire (909–945) (Schafer, 1954). Bud- dhism consolidated its crucial role in the Putian plains during the Song dynasty. Many early Buddhist monks established themselves in remote locations in mountain valleys. To the Han Chinese settlers and indig- enous peoples of the area they must have appeared as powerful magi- cians capable of subduing demons and wild animals and conquering the wilderness. Other Buddhist monks organized efficient monastic estates, which rapidly filled up with monks seeking Buddhist training and others evading taxes. This range of Buddhist monks, from moun- tain dwelling magician monks to powerful abbots of local monasteries, can still be found today in Putian. A third important intermediate cat- egory is the Buddhist monks who perform rituals. These monks form ritual troupes which are called on to perform consecrations of temples and ancestral halls, funerals and requiem services, and <i>pudu </i>rites of universal salvation for the hungry ghosts in villages throughout the Putian plain. Finally, one should add in the many lay Buddhist groups who can be found in Putian (see below), who perform their own ritu- als for their communities of initiates.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Many Buddhist monasteries, especially those built near to the tombs</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">of early founding ancestors of the Han Chinese lineages of Putian, were originally supported in large part by funds donated by these lineages. In return they were expected to perform sacrificial rites at the tombs of these ancestors, and in special graveside shrines dedicated to them. Sometimes these halls were independent structures (<i>yingtang </i><span class="s8">影堂</span>, image halls) inside of larger monastic compounds. By the late Song, these Buddhist monasteries had become the target on the one hand of local officials seeking to raise taxes, and the object of frustration</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 14: Mulan Nanyang irrigation system (of the southern plain)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 67</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="414" height="553" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_050.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 15: Beiyang irrigation systems (of the northern plain)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">68 chapter three</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="546" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_051.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 16: Jiuliyang irrigation system (of the northeastern Putian plain)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 69</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="551" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_052.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">70 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">on the other hand of their sponsoring lineages.

A number of these lineages began to experiment with new forms of ancestral worship, already in the Song dynasty. Zhu Xi commented on one such lineage, the Huang <span class="s8">黃 </span>of Huangxiang <span class="s8">黃 巷 </span>, in a stone inscription.<span class="s9">13 </span>He expressed admiration for their abil- ity to maintain ancestral sacrifices over several generations. In fact, in doing so they contravened key elements of his own prescriptions for ancestral worship as recorded in his <i>Family Rituals</i>. Later scholars would greatly extend the reach of ancestral worship beyond the limits described in this text, nevertheless thereby paradoxically fulfilling a central vision of Zhu Xi and Cheng Yi <span class="s8">程 頤 </span>(1033–1108) of bringing ancestral worship to the common people.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">According to Clark’s (2007) analysis, early Han settlers who had</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">moved to Putian and Xianyou counties in the Six Dynasties and the early Tang sought to distinguish themselves from a late Tang, Five Dynasties newly arrived elite associated with Wang Shenzhi <span class="s8">王審知 </span>and his army from Gushi <span class="s8">固始 </span>who founded the Min Kingdom. Clark notes that many of the earlier lineages of the Xinghua region had by this point lived in the area for five generations. They had already reached the limits of acceptable ancestral worship (restricted to five generations for officials). In order to stake their claim to official lineage status, several of these early arrivals began to break the restrictions on the limits of ancestral worship and to worship their original ances- tor in central China, along with their Putian founding ancestor, and eventually all subsequent generations of ancestors, especially those who had attained to official position. This led to the establishment of elaborate ancestral halls, with multiple niches for different categories of ancestors, all of which went far beyond the limits of the classical</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_053.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">13 </span>Zhu Xi <span class="s11">朱 熹 </span>, <i>Tang Guizhou feng Kaiguogong shi Zhongyi Huanggong citangji </i><span class="s11">唐 桂 州 刺 史 封 開 國 公 謚 忠 義 黃 公 祠 堂 記 </span>(1196), in Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials on the History of Religion in Fuijan: Xinghua Region </i><span class="s11">興 化 府 分 </span><span class="s16">册 </span>Fuzhou: Fujian renmin chubanshe, 1995: No. 29, pp. 30–31.

Many of the debates about ancestral worship of this period, and continuing into the Ming dynasty, centered on the notion that “Li yi yi qi” <span class="s8">禮以義起 </span>(Ritual arises from the meanings (or intentions, of those performing the rites). This was a revolutionary slogan which allowed for changes to take place in the forms of ancestral worship as long as the intentions of those performing the new rites were judged to be sincere and acceptable. Clark’s (2007) hypothesis about the origins of innovations in ances- tral worship in the Xinghua area is stimulating. Nonetheless, some problems remain with his conjecture. First of all, as he notes, there are no extant genealogical charts, registers, or stone inscriptions dating from the late Song that would clearly indicate which ancestors were worshipped by which set of descendants. Clearly only a few families in the late Tang and Five Dynasties period could have had the local status and the heritage of official rank needed to claim such rights of wor- ship, although many others would have imitated them and invented their own pedigrees. Even the earliest Han Chinese settlers would have brought along a host of dependents and hangers-on of different surnames (although many of these may have sought to change their names to that of their patrons). Local families of non-Han or mixed background must have greatly outnumbered Han settlers from the central plains, although many of them too may have sought to inter- marry or to otherwise link their family names to rising lineages. The extraordinary leap in Song dynasty population figures for the Xinghua area suggests that many local ethnic inhabitants must have decided to register their households on the tax ledgers in order to enjoy benefits and protection of membership in the Chinese imperial state.<span class="s9">14 </span>Thus many different groups, some of whom may have had different kinship structures, would perhaps have had an interest in pushing reforms in the ancestral system. Furthermore, the push for transformation of the classical ritual order of the lineage could also arise internally within a lineage whose major descent line (the line of descent of the eldest son) had failed, requiring the other minor branches of the lineage (the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="64" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_054.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 27pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">14 </span>Clark 1991: ch. 5 discusses available population figures for the Xinghua region. These move from 33,735 in 980 to 55,237 in 1080 and 72,363 in 1190–4. In 980 <i>kehu</i><span class="s11">客戶 </span>(guest, or migrant households) made up over 60% of the population, but this percentage dropped to around 40% in later figures.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">72 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">lines of descent of the other sons) to step in and conduct the ritual sacrifices, or build or repair the ancestral hall, thereby overstepping their ritually prescribed roles. This kind of structural-transformative explanatory model may also help us understand some aspects of the spread of new lineage practices in the area.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Lineages only achieved widespread ascendancy in Putian in the late Song and early Ming, when they were able to take control of con- siderable landholdings from the Buddhist monastic estates that had played such a major role in the area in the Song (when they owned one third of cultivable land). In the late Song, only a handful of lin- eages had established Family Temples or Ancestral Halls. By the mid- Ming, many more such halls had been built across the Putian plains, as more and more local sons passed the examinations and attained official office. The survey of village temples in the Putian plains men- tions over one hundred commemorative archways set up in honor of such success stories in the Ming (see <i>Map 19: Distribution of Memo- rial Archways Within Ritual Alliance Boundaries</i>). Sadly, only a few of these archways still survive.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The next pair of maps explores the question of the distribution of the main lineages in the Putian plains. Map 17 of the distribution of Song major lineages shows that many of these groups were concen- trated in or near Putian city (Kuokou was the main port), near the Yanshou Weir to the north of Putian, or along the Southern irrigated plain towards Huangshi town. According to Li Junfu’s <i>Puyang bishi</i>, the great majority of the main lineages lived within the walled city of Putian, but this is not shown on the following map.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Map 18: Major Lineages, jinshi (Metropolitan Graduates) and juren (Provincial Graduates) in the Ming Dynasty <span class="p">reveals the rising promi- nence of the lineages of the southern irrigated plain. Notice the con- centration of elites in newly reclaimed lands along the banks of the Mulan river. Observe also the relative lack of elite lineages in the Jiuli- yang region to the northeast of the Putian plain. This is the region that has the most developed tradition of collective spirit medium trainings and performances. These distributions indicate the long history of the development of distinct sub-cultures within different regions of the Putian plains.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A number of these lineages were celebrated with the bestowal</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">of a memorial archway in commemoration of the success in the examinations and official career of their native sons. <i>Map 19: Memorial</i></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 17: Distribution of Major Lineages in the Song Dynasty</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 73</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="409" height="572" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_055.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 18: Distribution of Major Lineages, <i>jinshi </i>and <i>juren </i>in the Ming Dynasty</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">74 chapter three</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="406" height="555" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_056.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 75</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Archways within Ritual Alliance Boundaries <span class="p">shows which ritual alli- ances had received one or more archways in the Song or Ming dynasty.

This regional cultural difference will be discussed further below.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One measure of the growing success of lineages in Putian was their ability to train scholar literati who went on to pass the imperial examinations and achieve an official position. In the 1,284 years from 620 to 1904, Putian produced 1,468 <i>jinshi </i><span class="s8">進士 </span>(Metropolitan Candi- dates). There were fifteen during the Tang, two during the Five Dynas- ties, 876 in the Song, 530 in the Ming, and seventy-one during the Qing. Peak years included twenty-three <i>jinshi </i>in 1100 and twenty-two in 1115, and nineteen in 1517 and twenty-one in 1522. Clark (2007: 214–32; and <i>Appendix </i>1 and 2) has provided a detailed analysis of the examination successes of Song <i>jinshi </i>from Putian and Xianyou. Clearly this was a period of extraordinary achievements in Confucian and Neo-Confucian studies (see Clark: 2007, Chap. 6.213–54, <i>Literati Culture of the Mulan Valley</i>). Clark notes that some 60 percent of the <i>jinshi </i>(794 out of 1339 degrees) went to members of the top five surname groups (Chen, Fang, Huang, Lin and Zheng). He concludes that while some Song surname groups such as the Fang must have encouraged most of their sons to study for the examinations, other lineages employed strategies of diversification within different lineage segments, so that most <i>jinshi </i>are concentrated within specific lines of descent. Diversification into farming, commerce, and the trades made sense as the success rate in the exams dropped from around ten per- cent to much close to one percent over the Song dynasty.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">Literati from Putian were deeply involved in leading intellectual debates of the day. The Neo-Confucian master Lin Guangchao <span class="s8">林光朝 </span>(Aixuan <span class="s8">艾軒</span>) (1114–1178) spread the teachings of Cheng Yi in his Hongquangong Shuinan Shuyuan <span class="s8">紅泉宮水南書院 </span>(Red Stream Temple Shuinan Academy) in Shuinan <span class="s8">水南 </span>(Huangshi <span class="s8">黃石</span>). His disciples continued his teachings. Putian Confucian scholars made a major impact on the elaboration of Neo-Confucian thought, as can be seen in the accounts of Putian scholars in the <i>Minzhong lixue yuanyuan kao </i><span class="s8">閩中理學淵流考 </span>(<i>Study of the original sources of the</i></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">76 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;"><i>School of Principle within Fujian</i>). At the same time that Master Lin Guangchao was running his academy, Zheng Qiao <span class="s8">鄭樵 </span>(1104–1162), another Xinghua native son, was compiling his massive compendium, the <i>Tongzhi </i><span class="s8">通志 </span>encyclopedia. Zheng Qiao credits the scholars of the Putian region who allowed him to consult their extensive personal libraries.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">During the Ming, Putian continued to produce an extraordinary number of examination graduates ( <i>juren </i>and <i>jinshi</i>), far out of pro- portion to the size of the region. 494 official positions in the Ming bureaucracy were occupied by natives of Putian in the Ming. Parsons (1969:214) notes that at least one member of the Chen surname group held office from 1403 to 1644, with the exception of the Longqing period (1567–1572). The Lin surname groups of Putian were almost as successful, with at least one Lin member in office throughout the Ming (1403–1644) with the exception of the Qingtai and Tianshun periods (1450–1464). Both surname groups produced their greatest numbers of officials during the Jiajing period (1522–1566). The Huang of Putian also had at least one member in office in the Yongle (1403– 1424) period and from the Chenghua through the Chongzhen periods (1465–1644), with the exception of the Longqing period (1567–72). They too had the most lineage members in office during the Jiajing period (1522–1566).</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Ming sources such as the <i>Xu Puyang bishi </i>reveal that each of these</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">large surname groups was divided into many different lines (<i>pai</i>). Thus for example the Lin living inside Putian City were divided into seven or eight distinct lines, located in different wards of the city, each of which produced between five to forty-six <i>jinshi</i>. Overall, some 425 <i>jinshi </i>are listed as having lived inside the walls of Putian City in the Ming, while 742 are listed as living in villages across the Putian plain and in other outlying regions of Putian. This gives some idea of the concentration of lineages, lineage halls, branch halls, Metropolitan Candidates, and retired officials within the city walls. At the same time, these figures show that there was a broad distribution of <i>jinshi </i>across the Putian plain, as shown in <i>Map 18: Distribution of Major Lineages, jinshi and juren in the Ming Dynasty</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">The Jiajing period was the high point of examination success for Putian lineages in the Ming. This period was however marred by Great Rites Controversy of 1524 (Fisher 1977).

He was enraged when the majority of his court officials protested against his planned ritual reform. The executions, beatings, public humiliation and summary dismissal given to many of these officials may have led those from Putian to decide to focus more attention on local concerns. Many Putian court officials, who had opposed the ritual changes demanded by the Emperor, ended up in extended retirement in Putian. There they would come face to face with the pirate army invasions of the 1560s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Temples and local cults</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Many of these retired official and local literati became involved in debates about ritual reforms in the Putian area, as this was one of their areas of classical scholarly expertise. Some of these debates cen- tered on reforms to ancestral worship, as mentioned above. Some had to do with the spreading influence of Wang Yangming’s <span class="s8">王 陽 明 </span>(1472–1529) alternative vision of a more populist, locally engaged Confucianism. Other more conservative scholars were concerned with the appropriateness of local popular changes to the sacrificial cults to local gods and the status of <i>shejitan </i>official altars dedicated to the soil and the harvest, as well as those to the spirits of the unrequited dead (<i>litan </i><span class="s8">厲 </span>) that had established in each <i>li </i>sub-canton at the beginning of the Ming dynasty.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">These altars had been intended to replace the vast range of temples to local gods, most of which were declared heterodox, and banned. An official <i>Register of State Sacrifices </i>was established, and different cult centers had to apply to enroll their gods onto this register. Inscription on the <i>Register </i>conferred new legitimacy on the cult center, and often came with new titles of enfeoffment or canonization for the god, and new imperial plaques for the temple. Officials from the local yamen were supposed to visit these temples and shrines and make offerings on the appropriate date each year, further enhancing the status of these sites in the eyes of the villagers (and the residents of neighboring villages). This system was a continuation of the canonization of local gods which had been systematized under the Song, but which can be traced back to early imperial times (Dean 1993, Hansen 1990).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 79</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Many of the gods and goddesses of the Putian plains had in fact received official canonization earlier during the Song dynasty.<span class="s9">15 </span>Some scholars have argued that the canonization of these deities was the principal mechanism for the achievement of recognition and accep- tance of the Putian area by the imperial court, and vice versa the main means for local individuals and the local culture to identify with the Empire.<span class="s9">16 </span>Some of the inscriptions discussed by Zheng Zhenman in Part Two below show a clear awareness of the importance of state recognition and canonization of their village gods. At the same time, they suggest that the situation was much more complicated, and that canonization could only reach to a small number of the many cults of worship being practiced in the Putian plain. Moreover, some Song inscriptions, such as the <i>Xiangyingmiaoji</i>, note with resignation the continuation of Buddhist and Daoist rituals even within temples and cults officially canonized and potentially converted into more Confu- cian directions (Clark 2007:193).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">The early Ming court was extremely grudging in its recognition</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">of local cults.<span class="s9">17</span><span class="s20"> </span>The founding emperor of the Ming, Zhu Yuanzhang,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_058.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">15 </span>These include close to twenty deities and temples listed in the <i>Qianlong Putian xianzhi</i>, all of whom received official titles through canonization during the Song dynasty.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">16 </span>Ke Dawei <span class="s11">科大衛 </span>(David Faure) and Liu Zhiwei <span class="s11">家認同—明清華 南地區宗族發展的意識形態基</span><span class="s16">丨 </span>(Lineage and the state identification of local society: the</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: justify;">ideological foundations of the development of the lineage in Ming and Qing south China) <i>Lishi yanjiu </i><span class="s11">歷史研究</span>, 2000.3. pp. 3–14.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">17 </span>List of temples recorded in gazetteers of the Putian area show a sharp drop in the number of temples listed in the early Ming, followed by a slow increase into the mid Qing gazetteers.

He severely restricted the official recognition of local cults, and forced many Buddhist monasteries to retract their extended networks of local Buddhist halls and temples. The centerpiece of his religious reform was the establishment of new <i>shêjitan </i>official altars of the soil and the grain and <i>litan </i>altars to the unrequited dead in every sub-canton of the empire. Imperial orders prescribed that the <i>shêjitan </i>altars should be open-air altars, on top of a mound of earth, marked with a tree. The gods should be represented by inscribed tablets, rather than by god statues. Representatives of each household or <i>jia </i>(ten households) should take part in the ritual sacri- fices at the <i>shêjitan </i>and <i>litan </i>altars on regular occasions. The sacrifices would be followed by a Wine Drinking ceremony and the recitation of an “Oath to refrain from abusing the weak and powerless in the com- munity” (Overmyer 1989–90).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">This was the consciously archaic sacrificial system, based on descrip- tions in the classical ritual texts of antiquity, which the Emperor sought to impose on all the local communities of China. The <i>lishê </i>system was part of a related but much broader set of reforms of the system of imperial administrative control, household registration, and taxation known as the <i>lijia </i><span class="s8">里甲 </span>system. This system of control was also based in the <i>li </i>sub-cantons, which rotated responsibility for tax payments between the members of each <i>jia</i>, who were also responsible for reporting on each other’s misdoings.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Putian plain was divided into some twenty-two <i>li </i>sub-cantons, as shown in <i>Map 20: Li Sub-cantons on the Putian Plain.</i><span class="s9">18</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The <i>li </i>sub-cantons of the Putian plains were divided in the early Ming into over 100 <i>tu </i>administrative units, which may have been the administrative spatial unit that was equipped with an official <i>sheji- tan </i>altar of the Soil and Harvest and a <i>litan </i>altar to the unrequited dead.<span class="s9">19 </span>The <i>Map Regional Ritual Alliances within Li sub-cantons of the</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_059.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">received canonizations during the Song.

In other words, most ritual alliances developed within the boundaries of the <i>li sub-canton</i>s, and perhaps originated in the <i>tu </i>subdivisions of the <i>li sub-canton</i>s. This could be interpreted as a straightforward top-down process of a transfer of symbolic powers and ritual-administrative spaces from the state sac- rificial system to a system of local temples. However, there was clear resistance to this process expressed by local Putian literati and by many officials in office. They seem to have sensed that this mutation of an official set of altars and rituals into a local form of ritual alli- ance, with its own rituals and deities, marked a major challenge to the presumed continuum of power of the imperial ritual order, and pointed to the rise of an alternative power formation rooted in the local temple alliances with their own sources of supernatural power. The most immediately egregious problems, from the point of view of the Confucian defenders of classical orthodoxy, were the anthro- pomorphic representations of the gods of the soil and the harvest, and the merging of the cults to these gods with cults to all kinds of unsanctified local deities, all on the same altar or in the same temple. Historical sources indicate that about fifty years after the establish- ment of the Ming empire, the system of official altars began to mutate into a network of local temples dedicated to local gods, incorporating an altar to the gods of the soil and the grain (<i>Chongkan Xinghua fuzhi</i>, 2006: 661).<span class="s9">20 </span>A few of the ancestral <i>shê </i>altars of the 153 ritual alliances currently active in the Putian plain can be traced back to early offi- cial Ming <i>shê </i>altars. These include Huangxiang village near Hanjiang, one of the early centers of the Huang lineage. Others include Qian- wang village near Jiangkou (called Qianhuang in the Ming and Qing sources), Shangyu village (now Daomei village) near Huangshi town on the southern irrigated plain, and the Longpo zushê near the north</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="64" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_062.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 35pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">villages.

Various zealous Confu- cian administrators and local fundamentalist Confucians fought back against these tendencies. Many local temples were torn down by these Confucian purists, but to little avail. Localities continued to merge <i>shêji </i>altars with their temples dedicated to local gods. In many cases, the original <i>shê </i>altar would become the ancestral <i>shê</i>, the <i>gushê </i><span class="s8">古社</span>. Branch temples would form in allied communities, forming <i>dongxi nanbei shê </i><span class="s8">東西南北社 </span>(eastern, western, northern and southern <i>shê</i>), in a cluster formation around the original founding temple. By adding additional temples above and below the cluster the alliance became a seven-fold ritual alliance, known locally as a <i>qijing</i>. Each village with its own <i>shê </i>altar and temple (often in one and same building), was an independent member of the ritual alliance, and able to participate in the processions and rituals of the alliance as an equal member. Vil- lages without their own <i>shê </i>were forced to link up with villages that had a <i>shê </i>altar in order to participate. This in turn led to pressures to create new <i>shê </i>altars for villages that sought to demonstrate their own ritual independence. The <i>shêmiao </i>temple system has remained central to the ritual alliances and ritual activities of the villages of the Putian plain to this day.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">These mutations did not go unnoticed by local champions of Con-</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: justify;">fucian orthodoxy. In the early Chenghua period (1465–1487), Peng Shao <span class="s8">彭韶 </span>stated in his “Letter to Prefect Lord (Zheng) Yue <span class="s8">與郡守岳公書</span>” that:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Putian was originally a land of barbarians, and its excessive shrines are especially numerous.

At this moment the Confucian scholar Lin Bangjun who abhorred exces- sive cults requested to take control over them and went around to all regions and whenever he encountered the site of an excessive cult, he ordered that it be demolished. In standing temples, he established the two altars of the village <i>shê </i>and village <i>li</i>, in accordance with the Hongwu ritual regulations. He caused the village elders to lead their community residents to conduct sacrifices at the appropriate seasons, and so there would be enough to sacrifice to the gods of the earth and grain, and the (unrequited dead of the l<i>itan</i>) would not be hungry like ghosts with no descendants.<span class="s19">22</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Peng Shao obtained his <i>jinshi </i>degree in 1457, and served as Minister of Punishments, and later retired to his home village.

What is especially noteworthy is that in the late Ming, the Putian scholar literati actively participated in the repair and construc- tion of popular god temples.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Subsequent fieldwork revealed that many village communities usurped the right to establish, move, and/or sub-divide <i>shê </i>altars long after the early to mid-Ming. By that time, the imperial court and the local yamen had given up trying to restrict popular worship to a restricted set of official <i>shêjitan </i><span class="s8">社稷壇 </span>altars. We also found many instances of a <i>sh</i>ê being divided due to internal conflicts from popula- tion pressure, struggles over the control of geomantic sites, growing class differentiation, and other factors. Nevertheless, the <i>shê </i>continued to serve as a key marker of ritual territory and local identity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Irrigation and rise of the ritual alliances <span class="p">(qijing)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Closer investigation of the evolution of the irrigation system also sug- gested additional reasons for the formation of local alliances. Many of the ritual alliances can be analyzed in relation to their contiguous position along a stretch of an irrigation canal, or in relation to a shared sluice gate or dike. As we looked more closely into the history of the irrigation system, marking the points of conflict that emerge in the written record (irrigation gazetteers, stone inscriptions, literati writ- ings), we noticed a striking proximity between one of the flashpoints in the history of the irrigation system and the rise of the first recorded ritual alliances around the year 1500. Such a point is the digging of a tertiary irrigation canal into Puban <span class="s8">蒲阪 </span>village which caused a marked slowing of the water flow in the main canal that flowed south- east from the Mulan Weir to the market town of Huangshi, a center of major lineages and literati-officials, and in the secondary canal which flowed north from about midway down the main canal to the Qing- jiang region near the Mulan river, another center of literati-officials. We surmise, based on a reading of the protests lodged by scholar lite- rati elites of both regions, that they were unable to resolve the problem through relying on their access to the state (i.e., their ability to speak directly to the district magistrate).<span class="s9">26 </span>What appears to have happened</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_065.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">26 </span>Sources on conflicts within the irrigation systems include Dean and Zheng, <i>Epi- graphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 130, pp. 152–3; <i>Chongkan Xinghua Fuzhi</i>, 2007 ed.:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 22: An interesting intersection of irrigation canals on the Putian plain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 87</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="538" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_066.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">88 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">instead is that local leaders of both regions established the two first regional ritual alliances, each made up of seven villages, in the histori- cal record. By mobilizing the local population through ritual means, the local elites may have found a way to take control over the main- tenance of the irrigation system in a situation where compromise and mutual assistance was imposed by the environmental limits of the irri- gation system. If so, this would indicate a major change from earlier lineage based management of the irrigation system to a new system of temple based multi-lineage patterns of control and maintenance of the irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Due to the intricate nature of the overall irrigation system, particular stretches of the system could be drastically affected by interventions elsewhere, upstream in the system. The first recorded <i>qijing </i>sevenfold alliances to appear on the Putian plain may well have formed in response to just such problems. These were the ritual alliances of Huangshi and Qingjiang, each made up of seven villages, mentioned in the <i>(Hongzhi) Chongkan Xinghua fuzhi </i>of 1503 (2007:274). These new ritual alliances represented different coalitions of lineages. The Huangshi lineages claimed descent from the Fourteen Surnames who had assisted in the digging (and the subsequent maintenance) of the main channel of the Mulan irrigation system back in 1083.<span class="s9">27 </span>The Qingjiang lineages (primarily the Zhou <span class="s8">周 </span>and <span class="s8">the </span>Zheng <span class="s8">鄭</span>) were more recently prominent groups of gentry-literati, several of whom had passed the imperial examinations and risen to high official posi- tions in the Ming dynasty. These two groups fought over changes to the ritual order at the temples situated at the head of the Mulan Weir that took place in the early decades of the 16th century. During this time, they would also be drawn into conflict by concrete interventions to the irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The construction of the Mulan Weir and the digging of its main irrigation canals and channels, had been essential to the reclaiming of the southern irrigated plain from the sea, and thus to the settlement of the entire irrigated plain. To review the history of the Mulan irrigation system, in 1064, Lady Qian attempted to build a weir (a breakwater dam across a stream designed to separate rising tidal sea water from</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_067.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">252.; Chen Maolie <i>Putian shuilizhi</i>, 1974:149–52; 168, 178–82, 188, 202–03, 231–2,</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">240, 245–67, 253, 322–9, 532, 669–80.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">27 </span>The Fourteen Surname (Groups) include three Yu <span class="s11">余 </span>surname groups, seven Zhu</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">朱 <span class="s7">surname groups, and one each of the Lin </span>林<span class="s7">, Chen </span>陳 <span class="s7">and Gu </span>顧 <span class="s7">surnames.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 89</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">the downstream flow of fresh water, and to divert the latter into chan- nels for irrigation purposes) across the Lai river upstream of the cur- rent Mulan weir. Just as she was celebrating the success of the weir by holding a party on top of it, the force of the water collapsed the dam, and she was swept away and drowned. A local official named Li Zhen<span class="s8">黎畛 </span>also died in this accident. Legend has it that Lady Qian’s corpse floated upstream past a group of thirteen villages which subsequently built temples in her honor.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In 1070, a <i>jinshi </i>named Lin Congshi <span class="s8">林從世 </span>attempted to build another weir further downstream, but this dam also collapsed. Finally, in 1075, a man named Li Hong <span class="s8">李宏 </span>from Fuqing to the north, per- haps responding to the call of Wang Anshi <span class="s8">王安石 </span>(1021–1086) for major infrastructural projects, raised 70,000 cash and enlisted the sup- port of the so-called Fourteen Surnames, kin-groups living along the path of the projected irrigation canal, to donate land and labor for the building of the Mulan weir. The weir was completed in 1083. Li Hong was aided in his selection of the site by a mysterious monk named Master Feng Zhiri <span class="s8">馮智日</span>, who gave him a magical box to toss into the river to indicate the correct spot to build the weir. This legend is first given in a stele record by the Xinghua polymath Zheng Qiao.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The ten kilometer canal Li Hong had dug reached just past Huang- shi town to the Dayu <span class="s8">大嶼 </span>hill at the (then) seaside, and allowed for over 10,000 <i>mu </i>(1600 acres) to be irrigated. Several earlier irrigation reservoirs established in the Tang were drained and the land within them was dedicated to the descendants of Li Hong (and in some ver- sions, to the descendants of the Fourteen Surnames as well). A number of Li Hong’s relatives (he had no sons) became monks in monasteries in the area, or took charge of sacrificial lands and ritual functions. Other properties were bequeathed to an Irrigation Maintenance Office, established in 1119, to manage the canals. Various sacrificial lands and weir maintenance lands were preserved to cover the expenses of ritu- als at the temples built in honor of Li Hong and Lady Qian at the Mulan Weir. Over 100 <i>mu </i><span class="s8">畝 </span>of land (sixteen acres) was set aside for Li Hong’s temple. The descendants of the “Fourteen Surnames” claimed that over 300 <i>mu </i><span class="s8">畝 </span>of land (fifty acres) was given tax-free to their ancestors for assisting Li Hong in the digging of the main irrigation canal.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The temple built at the Mulan weir initially housed Li Hong, Lady Qian, and the spirit tablets of the Fourteen Surnames. The temple applied for and received an imperial plaque and titles of enfeoffment</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">90 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">for Marquis Li Hong and Lady Qian in the Song dynasty. In 1262, Li Hong was enfeoffed as Huiji hou (Marquis of Humane Salvation). Other changes to the temple complex arose from local interventions. Even earlier, in the Shaoding period (1228–33), 140 mu of tax-exempt sacrificial land had been approved to cover the costs of ritual sacrifices for his cult. Liu Kezhuang (1187–1269), a retired Putian official and voluminous commentator on Song local society, wrote an inscription which called for the separate worship of Li Hong and Lady Qian (who was moved to a back hall) on grounds of propriety.<span class="s9">28 </span>The Fourteen Surnames ancestral tablets were set to Li Hong’s right hand side. In 1327, under the Yuan dynasty, the Board of Rites approved special individual rites for Li Hong in his own temple on the right side of the Mulan Weir.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Mulan irrigation system continued to develop rapidly, with</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">additional channels, secondary canals, and tertiary irrigation conduits added at a rapid rate. Nowadays, the southern irrigated plain is made up of seven major channels, twenty-four secondary canals, and 109 irrigation conduits. In 1315 a major change was made at the head of the system by diverting 30 percent of the water into a channel flowing north around Putian city, and linking up with three earlier, smaller- scale irrigation systems within the northern plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The early Ming presented a grave challenge to the legitimacy of the cults of the Mulan system, as Ming Taizu was determined to reign in popular cult worship. The descendants of Li Hong and the Fourteen Surnames were able to persuade the court to uphold the official rites for Li Hong, Lady Qian and the Fourteen Surnames’ ancestors, and to continue to honor the tax-free status of the lands dedicated to the sacrifices at the temple and the maintenance of the irrigation system. In the first year of the Ming dynasty, 1368, these rites, honors and tax exemptions were approved once again by the Board of Rites. The temple was rebuilt, and the gods were shifted around again. This time Li Hong and Li Zhen were worshipped in an eastern hall. The front hall housed Lin Jinshi and the Fourteen Ancestors. Lady Qian was worshipped as before in the back hall.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1511 a temple keeper named Li Xiong <span class="s8">李熊</span>, who claimed to be</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">a descendant of Li Hong, tore down the original temple to Lady Qian and the ancestors of the Fourteen Surnames.

Li Xiong dared to take these actions because he had allied himself with newly emergent Zhou <span class="s8">周 </span>and Zheng <span class="s8">鄭 </span>gentry families who lived in the Qingjiang <span class="s8">清 江 </span>area near the banks of the Mulan river, in a recently reclaimed region of the Southern plain, watered by a perpendicular secondary canal that joins the main irrigation channel halfway down near Quqiao (see <i>Map 27: Interesting Intersection of Irri- gations Canals on the Southern Putian Plain </i>above). Li Xiong asked Zheng Yue <span class="s8">鄭 岳 </span>, a prominent retired scholar-official from Puban vil- lage near Qingjiang, to compose a <i>Mulan Beiji </i><span class="s8">木 蘭 陂 集 </span><i>Collection (of sources) on the Mulan Weir </i>to support his claims to the temple complex and it sacrificial estate.<span class="s9">29 </span>He may also have persuaded Zhou Ying <span class="s8">周 瑛 </span>, a local official and co-editor of the <i>(Hongzhi) Chongkan Xinghua Fuzhi </i>gazetteer, to downplay the significance of the contribu- tion of the Fourteen Surnames to the building of the Mulan Weir and its main irrigation channel. In this gazetteer completed in 1503, in the midst of a campaign against heterodox cults (<i>yinsi </i><span class="s8">淫 祀 </span>), Zhou Ying supported the cult of Li Hong and Lady Qian, but claimed that the 70,000 strings of cash used for the construction of the Weir was prob- ably Li Hong’s own money, and that those who aided him were prob- ably simply forced into providing corvée labor for the project.<span class="s9">30 </span>The only specific mention he makes of the Fourteen Surnames implies that they were the heads of wealthy families that had benefitted from the Mulan irrigation system who were therefore made responsible for the regular maintenance of the Weir and the main irrigation channels.<span class="s9">31 </span>This appears to be part of a pattern, as a memorial to the court from Censor Zhou Jinlong <span class="s8">周 進 隆 </span>requesting renewed official sacrifices for Li Hong, and grudgingly allowing for continued sacrifices for Lady Qian, Li Zhen, and Li Congshi (but with no mention of the ancestors of the Fourteen Surnames) was accepted in 1497 by the Ministry of Rites in Beijing.

The descendants of the Fourteen Surnames, who lived primarily in the Huangshi area at the far end of the Song period irrigation channel dug by Li Hong, were aghast at the dishonor done to their ancestors, and to the loss of sev- eral hundred <i>mu </i>of sacrificial lands and tax free status. They struck back by compiling the <i>Mulanbeizhi </i><span class="s8">木蘭陂志 </span>(<i>Account of the Mulan Weir</i>).<span class="s9">33 </span>Their representatives, including one Chen Benqing <span class="s8">陳本清</span>, submitted a legal brief in 1519 against Li Xiong, accusing him of twelve crimes, including forging his ancestral link to Li Hong, destroying ste- lae inscribed with accounts of the deeds of the Fourteen Surnames, tearing down the temple to Lady Qian in order to build his own house with the timber, and printing willfully distorting historical records.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">They also claimed that Li Xiong had maliciously destroyed an impe- rial plaque that had been displayed at the temple to Lady Qian and the Fourteen Ancestors bearing the words “Imperially Enfeoffed Virtuous Ministers”. Moreover, they charged that some of the earliest inscrip- tions relating to the cult of the founders of the Mulan Weir irrigation system, had been deliberately altered by Li Xiong in order to deny the importance of the role of the Fourteen Surnames.<span class="s9">34 </span>They stated that Zheng Qiao’s original phrase, “Li Hong then recruited the Fourteen Great Surnames to provide him with 70,000 strings of cash”, had been excised from the printed text of the lost stele (in Zheng Yue’s <i>Col- lection on the Mulan Weir</i>). Similarly, Liu Kezhuang’s comment that “(d)uring the Yuanyou reign (1086–1093), at the request of Magis- trate Jun . . . the Eryimiao was built to offer sacrifices to Qian, Li, Lin and the Fourteen Surnames”, had also been deliberately cut out of the version that went into the <i>Xinghua fuzhi</i>.

The final judgment, rendered in 1521, was in large measure a vindication for Li Xiong. The court determined that although he was not a direct descendant of Li Hong, his acts of reverence towards the founder of the irrigation system entitled him to maintain control over the temple, and a good portion of the sacrificial lands connected to it. The descendants of the Fourteen Surnames were left to lick their wounds. In 1553 they managed to rebuild a temple to house the ances- tral tablets of the Fourteen Surnames behind the new Lady Qian tem- ple. The case did not stop there however, for they claimed that a son of Li Xiong took advantage of the pirate invasions of the Jiajing period (1522–1566) to burn down the rebuilt temple, causing them to have to rebuild it a third time in 1594. The entire case lingered on until the mid-Qing, when it was brought forward by later descendants of the Fourteen Surnames yet again with the publication of the <i>Mulan bei- zhi </i>in 1732, in an effort to right the record in advance of what would become the Qianlong edition of the <i>Putian xianzhi </i>gazetteer.<span class="s9">36 </span>The situation became so difficult for editors of regional gazetteers that the last of these, the final <i>jinshi </i>from Putian, Zhang Qin <span class="s8">張琴</span>, stated that he would simply repeat the words of (both sides) in the debate in his section on the history of irrigation in Putian, “not daring to change a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_071.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">35 </span>This phrase is missing from the received text.

Recall that the backers of Li Xiong were based in Qingjiang, near the Mulan river, at the end of a major fork in the original channel dug by Li Hong. This area was reclaimed from the sea and settled primarily in the early Ming. The descendants of the Fourteen Surnames lived closer to the original main channel of the Mulan Weir irrigation system in and around Huangshi town. There was already considerable tension between these two groups over water rights as the area to the north of Qingjiang along the Mulan river was being reclaimed in the early Ming, while at the same time the even larger newly reclaimed area to the east of Huangshi was being opened up for cultivation and new village settlements all the way into the late Ming.<span class="s9">38</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Proof of the intricacy and fragility of the irrigation system can be seen in the episode that took place right in between the two first <i>qijing </i>ritual alliances, around the year 1525.

The Puban irrigation conduit takes water from a second- ary irrigation channel which is perpendicular to the main irrigation canal. This secondary channel links with the main canal near Quqiao, about halfway down the canal to the Huangshi area. Paradoxically, this diversion of even more water flow to the north (and then off to the east towards Puban village) eventually led to severe water shortages in many villages to the north in the Xindu and Qingjiang area, as well as in villages near Shaban and Huangshi town.<span class="s9">40</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Both of these areas had strong scholar-literati gentry lineages, one dating back to the Song, and the other to the Ming. These groups attempted to call on the local government (the district magistrate and the provincial governor’s office) to resolve the issue, but the complexity of the problem now exceeded the ability of the government to inter- vene on a case by case basis. Although in this particular case a district magistrate did eventually (in Wanli 34, or 1604) establish a system for the distribution of water at the secondary canal (separating and fixing the proportion of water that should flow north (30%) along the perpendicular secondary canal and southeast along the main channel (70%), this action was too little too late.<span class="s9">41 </span>This is but one example of the long-term unanticipated effects of adding just one more irrigation canal to an already intricately inter-connected system, leading to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_073.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">40 </span>Dredging of the irrigation canals and channels is said by Chen Chiyang to have first taken place during the Hongzhi period (1488–1505) (<i>Putian shuilizhi</i>, 1974: 151). Zheng Yue also made makes several observations on the reasons for the overall crisis of the irrigation system in his <i>Mulanbeiji </i>(Collection on the Mulan Weir). These include the silting in of canals, resulting in their becoming more and more shallow. Moreover, illicit digging of openings into the irrigation channels had become more widespread, so that if there was little rainfall, certain channels would run dry. Worse still, sand and mud had silted up the Mulan Weir itself, allowing seawater to spill over into the irrigation channel and then into the fields, destroying crops, and further silting up the irrigation system. Finally, the deforestation of mountains like Mt. Hu had led to major runoffs of topsoil which further clogged the irrigation canals (Chen, <i>op. cit</i>. 151) Zhou Ying also discussed instances of irrigation canals running dry due to excessive demands on the systems from newly reclaimed lands, or due to breaches in the dikes (<i>Cuiqu zhaigao </i><span class="s11">翠渠摘稿</span>, j. 2, 31b–33b).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">41 </span>Putian District Magistrate Cai Shanji <span class="s11">蔡 善 繼 </span>issued a proclamation determining</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;">the dimensions of the sluice gates in channels that divide near Quqiao, with one going north towards Xindu (and Qingjiang) and the other continuing south to Shaban (and onwards to Huangshi). The Xinghua Prefect Wang Jiazhong <span class="s11">王嘉忠 </span>forbade the villagers of Shaban from blocking the secondary channel carrying water to the north.

In this case, the ritual alliances of the Qingjiang area and those of Huangshi region were both affected and both would have remonstrated to the district magistrate. Thus despite their arguments over the ritual order of the temples at the head of the Mulan Weir irrigation system, these ritual alliances were forced to compromise with one another to some degree in this case because of their shared dependence on the irriga- tion system.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The alliances between powerful lineages appear to have begun to mutate over the 16th century into broader temple alliances. These alli- ances could mobilize local populations more effectively for the joint, cooperative (by necessity) management of the irrigation system. New forms  of  ritual,  including  multi-alliance  processions  around  higher order temples, developed at this point to attempt to better integrate and manage entire swaths of the irrigation system. Ritual alliances gradually extended over the entire irrigated alluvial plain. By the 1730’s, even villages outside the immediate irrigation system, such as those along the foothills of the Hugong mountains to the south of the irrigated plain, were forming their own alliances, as seen in ste- lae recording the involvement of a thirty-six village alliance with four spirit worshipping societies based in the Lingyundian temple atop the volcanic cone of Mt. Hu (see Dean and Zheng, 1995: No. 216, p. 251, <i>Chongxiu Lingyundian juanzi juantianbei </i><span class="s8">重修凌雲殿捐資捐田碑 </span>(Stele on the contributions of land and money for the restoration of the Temple that Surpasses the Clouds).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As one region gathered into a ritual alliance, other regions nearby would do the same. The process continued into the late 19th century, when for example in 1896 the Linshangong near Fengting in Xianyou was established as an alliance of thirty-six independent villages. A side altar in the temple is dedicated to the eighteen young men who died in battles to defend the alliance from a neighboring cluster of Zhu single surname villages that had historically controlled water supplies to the region of the thirty-six villages and kept most of the villagers as their tenant farmers.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Currently there are 153 regional ritual alliances across the Putian plain (see Map 23).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Within the regional ritual alliances, higher order alliances gradu- ally developed, linking together several alliances around a common temple. <i>Map 24: Higher Order Ritual Alliances on the Putian Plain</i></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 23: Regional ritual alliances on the Putian plain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 97</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="414" height="546" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_074.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">98 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">(below) shows the distribution of these larger collective alliances, each of which is marked by a massive procession of all the participating alliances and their villages. These higher order alliances and their central temples, processions and rituals, are described in detail in the <i>Survey</i>. The common temples of these higher order alliances served as regional centers for the maintenance of the local networks of the irrigation systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One example of this kind of irrigation management committee can be seen in the northeast corner of the Putian plain, in the Jiuliyang irrigation system. The Nanan weir (or Jiuliyang) irrigation system begins at an opening on the south side of the Qiulu river into which water is diverted just above the weir (which is a low lying partial dam across the river). The water runs along a long stone canal which runs eastwards just alongside the Qiulu river, and then divides off into three perpendicular canals running southwards across the plain. The fur- thest west, and closest to the mountains, of these south flowing canals irrigates the area known as Dingyang <span class="s8">頂洋 </span>(Upper Paddy fields), the second crosses the Neidai <span class="s12">内</span><span class="s8">埭 </span>(Inner Dikelands), and the third runs in front of the Waidai <span class="s8">外埭 </span>(Outer Dikelands). Each strip of land was developed in a different era—the Dingyang band that runs along the base of the mountains was irrigated in the Northern Song, while the Neidai was settled in the Southern Song as land was reclaimed from the sea, and the Waidai was reclaimed, irrigated and settled up to the end of the Ming.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Jiuliyang irrigation system flows across the three Li sub- cantons of Daishengli <span class="s8">待聖里</span>, Yongfengli <span class="s8">永豐里</span>, and Wangjiangli<span class="s8">望江里</span>. The area was further subdivided administratively into fifteen <i>Jia </i>(household registration units). It is difficult to know how many <i>lishêtan </i>and <i>litan </i>were set up in this region. Only Qianwang village in the Fengmei ritual alliance is identified in early sources as having had an official <i>lishêtan</i>. Some villages that belonged to the same <i>li </i>sub- canton drew water from different irrigation canals, and may therefore have formed alliances based on these “natural irrigation communi- ties”. Early sources state that there were seventeen villages on the plain in the early Ming. By the late Qing other sources record twenty-nine villages. Currently, we count sixty-four villages organized into seven ritual alliances spread across the plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 85%;text-align: justify;">Local systems evolved for the collective management of the irriga- tion system.

The upper canal is four feet deep, and has a deep sluice gate. It irrigates the waters of the Third <i>Jia </i>(made up of ) Qianwang, Fengmei, and Xiaxiao village. At Shijian, the canal irrigates Jiangkou and the Xinfeng dikelands, the Ou dikelands, and the Li dikelands. The lower canal is divided into the middle and lower canals. The middle canal irrigates the fields of Shang- lin, Shiting, Pucheng, Dongshi, Xiliu, Yupu, Tiantou, and Houguo. The lower canal irrigates the Fourth <i>Jia </i>(consisting of ) Wu mound, Dong Cai, Xiacuo, and Goushang villages, as well as Nangshansi monastery, Cheng mound, Lower Mound, and Waidai (outer dikelands) fields. Prior to the opening up of the lower canal into the middle and lower (second- ary) canals, there was the seven inch opening (<i>hankou </i><span class="s18">涵口</span>) which irri- gated the Jiangkou <i>Jia </i>as well as Hedai dikelands and the Zhuo dikelands fields. Each of the above territories had its own water, and if anyone tried to secretly block it or steal water, (these villages) are permitted to (draft a complaint) and on the basis of this declaration to take their case to the Office for the Welcoming of Immortals (within the Donglaisi temple) for a resolution and an investigation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The 1884 <i>Nan’anbei shanhou zhangcheng </i>(Rules and regulations of the Nan’an Weir) stone inscription further explains that:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">The Nan’an Weir has established one person each as the Gongzheng<span class="s18">公正 </span>(public rectifier), and the Fuzheng <span class="s18">副正 </span>(Assistant Rectifier).

Whenever it is time to repair the irrigation system, each <i>Jia </i>provides the (grain) yield of so many mu <span class="s18">畝</span>, gathering strings of thousands of cash on the basis of the amount of land under irrigation. The responsibility for seeking out and gathering these funds is that of the <i>Nenggan </i>(capable persons), who are not allowed to refuse or conceal (any funds). When the irrigation canals silt up with mud, the repairs are done by each <i>Jia </i>that lives along the (relevant) section of the canal. As for the dredging of sand and stones at the head of the Weir, the old regulations take the amount of land of each <i>Jia </i>into consideration, and send out the appro- priate number of workers, and the responsibility for mobilizing these laborers falls upon the <i>Nenggan </i>of each <i>Jia</i>, who cannot refuse or be lazy about this. Should the <i>Nenggan </i>of a particular <i>Jia </i>pass away, then another person will be publicly selected by the elders to take his place, and no one should try to pass this responsibility off, as this would lead to the demise of public affairs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This system of <i>Nenggan </i>or <i>Jiashou </i><span class="s8">甲首 </span>(heads of the <i>Jia</i>) managed the everyday repairs to the irrigation system, but larger repairs required the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">100 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">intervention of local gentry and the local government.<span class="s9">42  </span>A higher level of leadership thus played a role in the administration of the irrigation system. According to a stele dated 1727 and entitled <i>Xiu Nan’anbei ji</i><span class="s8">修南安陂記 </span>(<i>Record of the repairs of the Nan’an Weir</i>), “According to the ancient regulations, each of the twelve villages of Jiangkou selects one <i>Jia </i>head, and each year they provide one picul of grain to cover the costs of repairs. If the <i>Jia </i>Heads steal the grain for their personal profit, this leads to the ruin of public affairs. This kind of corvée ser- vice is managed by a committee made up of Jiansheng Yu Tingliang, Shengyuan Li Guozhang, and Liyuan Li Tingfang.”</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">Finally, another except from the 1884 <i>Nan’anbei shanhou zhangcheng</i><span class="s8">南安陂善後章程 </span>(Rules and regulations of the Nan’an Weir) stone inscription states that:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">The stone water pipes along the upper channel irrigate the paddy fields of Jiangkou <span class="s18">江 口 </span>, Duweitou <span class="s18">度 圍 頭 </span>, Waixindai <span class="s18">外 新 埭 </span>, Xinfengdai <span class="s18">新 豐 埭 </span>, Oudai <span class="s22">歐 </span><span class="s18">埭 </span>, and Zhuodai <span class="s18">卓 埭 </span>. In the past stones were placed to check the water flow and force the water into the mouths of the water pipes. Now because over and over again these stones have been removed and hidden away, not enough water is attained, which has led to dis- putes, and this has also led to the banks and dikes of the upper and lower channels being dug into and harmed. Now the relative heights of the upper and lower channels are clearly different. The border marking dikes along the middle stretches have been paired down, so that there are many holes through which water escapes. This has led to the water from the upper channel gradually all flowing into the lower channel. Thus the irrigation (of these areas) is unequal.

They would also agree on a collective contract. He issued special account books to ensure that funds were spent appropriately. His role, while important, was more one of coordinating the equitable gathering of funds, and supervising the dispersal of funds.

The rise of mercantile capitalism within China was espe- cially rapid and disruptive along the Southeast coast. Rent resistance became common, and an impoverished underclass of coastal fisher- men and smugglers developed along the Fujian coast. The arrival of Western mercantile trade in Southeast Asia and the China Sea led to increasing tensions within long-established Asian trading networks. Eventually, the Ming government reversed course on its plans for extensive overseas naval expeditions, and instead banned international trade. This policy only increased the instances of piracy and coastal raiding (Antony 2003, Murray 1987). Between 1410 and 1563, roam- ing armies of pirates attacked the Putian plain fifteen times, leading to a loss of life estimated to total over 150,000 people. These pirates were a mixed group, made up of coastal smugglers, transnational traders, and displaced peoples. In Chinese sources they are often called “dwarf pirates”, implying that they were marauders from Japan, but histori- ans have concluded that the majority were in fact Chinese. The most devastating raids in the greater Fujian area occurred between 1555 and 1563, during which time one prefectural seat (Xinghua), eleven county seats, four guard garrisons and four battalion garrisons in the coastal regions of Fujian were captured by the pirates, and a further twenty- two provincial, prefectural, and county seats and other local defence centers were besieged. In 1562, shortly after one group of pirates had been driven off by General Qi Jiguang <span class="s8">戚 繼 光 </span>, the walled city of Putian was captured for two months by another pirate army numbering over</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_077.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;">43 <span class="s7">The inscriptions quoted above are from stelae preserved in the Nanan Weir Irri- gation Bureau Office in Jiangkou, Putian.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 103</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">4000 men, and four hundred members of the gentry were put to death, along with thousands of commoners.

In the past eight years, two out of every ten have died beneath their knives. Four or five in ten have been kidnapped for ransom by these pirates. As for those who have fled to other commanderies, they are beyond number. Each prefecture has been struck by plague, and it is especially bad in the walled towns and cities. In one ward, five or six of ten have died in each family. Even families of several tens of people have lost sixty or seventy per cent, and some have been completely exter- minated. The sound of weeping is heard in every doorway, and corpses pile up and block the roadways. Beyond the city walls, for a thousand leagues, everything is a wasteland. Tall grasses grow in the paddy fields, and thorns grow in the marketplaces. Formerly, <i>li </i>sub-cantons that had ten <i>tu </i>(hundred households) now have only one or two, and (those <i>tu</i>) that once had ten <i>jia </i>(sets of ten households) now have only one or two <i>jia </i>left in each (Lin Run, <i>Yuanzhi shugao </i><span class="s18">愿治疏稿</span>, cited in Zheng (2001:203).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In 1558, Shi Lishou of Putian wrote a more personal account of these harrowing experiences in his “Record of the Suffering from the Pirates”, an essay included in the <i>(Jinjiang) Linpu tang Shishi zupu </i>[<i>Genealogy of the Linputang Shi Lineage </i>(of Jinjiang)]:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">In 1550, I was responsible for the sacrificial ritual. So many lineage members came to participate in the sacrifice that it was difficult to count them; the descendents young and old numbered over eight hundred in all. Who would have expected that in 1559 the pirates would enter Fujian? At first they attacked Hanjiang. People worried that they were not safe. They observed the smoke from the burning and were warned. In 1559 and 1560, the pirates repeatedly invaded our land, but we could still flee behind the walls of the coastal forts, so for the most part our lives were protected and saved. Then by 1561, the pirates occupied a stockade on the coast, assembled together, and did not disperse. On November 5, they took the Shenhu police office, capturing and killing more than half the people. On March 12, 1562, they took Yongning guard garrison, and only a few remained from our whole lineage. Everyone cried out beneath the knives and scurried about amidst the swords. Ransoms had to be paid to recover the living; money had to be paid to recover the corpses of the dead. Bodies and skeletons lay scattered in the wilds; dwellings were burnt down. Luckily, the site of the ancestral hall survived, but the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">104 chapter three</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">images of the four early ancestors were all broken. Furthermore, pesti- lence arose at the same time. Those who had been lucky enough to escape the hands of the fierce brigands now passed away one after the other morning and night . . . I was besieged in Aocheng. Of the ten members of my family only two survived. Of my four younger brothers only one survived. Of our dozens of young servants, not a single one remained. In the senior branch there were only sixty odd people, and in the sec- ond branch only fifty odd . . . Now, in 1585, I am sixty-one years of age. Observing how the population of the lineage is ever increasing, I wish to compile the genealogy, but the research is difficult. Luckily, Shiyu and Guangbiao, great-great uncles of the second branch, had a genealogy they had taken to Quanzhou, which has been brought back and shown to me. This indicates that Heaven does not intend to destroy the trans- mission of our lineage. So I have written this record to show to the later generations, to let them know the reasons for our decline at that time, and also to show the descendants of later generations the circumstances of our suffering then.

He argues that many lineages underwent a profound transformation from inheritance lineages or control-subordination lineages into contractual lineages over this period.<span class="s9">44 </span>Many lineages found themselves fundamen- tally transformed by these disruptions. For example, the “Preface on the Reconstruction of the Family Temple” of the Zhu of Qianjiang in Xianyou, dated 1573, and included in the <i>(Xianyou) Qianjiang Zhushi zupu  [Lineage  Genealogy  of  the  Qianjiang  Zhu  lineage  of  Xianyou] </i>states:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">In 1322, Wenyi first constructed this shrine in three halls, to serve as the site for the descendants to venerate and require [the ancestors].

This leads to the development of a control-subordination lineage. The latter may be tempted to diversify by selling shares in the lineage, thereby transforming into a “contractual lineage”. Zheng points out that lineages can transform into new types, or return to earlier forms, or even dissolve back into nuclear families, depending on a range of variables.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 105</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">tain land, and [land that could be reclaimed from the] sea In the late</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Jiajing <span class="s18">嘉靖 </span>period of the current dynasty, the barbarians swarmed up, destabilizing Fujian and Guangdong, doing evil in the localities, and treating people’s lives like they were no more than weeds. The bodies piled up and the blood flowed. The descent-line and the community altars were laid waste. The people were unable to live together and bring order to their locale. Only now in 1573 has peace returned. Fathers and sons who were formerly separated live together, flourish, and know the joys of life. Still, after the turmoil and flight, we live in peace but reflect on that dangerous time. We care not for profit, and our striving for righteousness is like a thirst.

We do not dare to allow less than twenty, for less would be insufficient to accomplish the matter. We do not dare to ask for more than twenty, for more would frighten men’s hearts and would lead to the task being abandoned. In this way, everyone came to an agreement. The date was February 20. It was also decided to draw up a register, to record the names and branches of all the donors. This will be used to restrain people’s hearts, and will also have the sense of creating a blood oath between them. Next, the record can be used as the standard [for collecting funds] and people will ready the money so that their names are marked off In this way, our efforts</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">will harmonize and our hearts link, and we can then accomplish this meritorious matter.

In the Qing dynasty, these units, which were considerably smaller than the <i>li</i>-sub-cantons, and in some cases smaller than the ritual alliances as well, became the primary locus of official coercive administration (policing, taxation, local defense). These <i>pu </i>territorial units have left their mark on the regional ritual system, especially in the Hushi area at the southernmost edge of the Mulan Weir southern irrigated plain. There several temples are known to this day as <i>pu </i>temples. In one large ritual alliance still active today, a local man dresses up as the “<i>pu </i>official”, and first announces the procession to the “<i>Pu </i>Headquarters”, before being carried in a sedan chair to lead the procession to all the villages of the alliance.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The pirate raids created other reasons to establish higher order temples within the Putian plains. In 1566, the gentry of Huangshi sent a delegation to Wudangshan <span class="s8">武 當 山 </span>to request a division of incense from Xuantian shangdi <span class="s12">玄 </span><span class="s8">天 上 帝 </span>, and brought a statue of that powerful god back to the newly built Beichengong <span class="s8">北 辰 宮 </span>(Temple of the Northern Asterism) near Huangshi. The immediate reason the Huangshi literati sought the protection of Xuantian shangdi was that pirate invasions had decimated their community (also known as Shuinan). The moans of countless ghosts were heard at night, and local leaders prayed that Xuantian shangdi would settle their laments and suppress any lingering demonic influences. Of course, the act of moving outside the local symbolic universe, traveling to Wudangshan, a mountain center of the cult of Xuantian shangdi prominently patronized by the Ming court, and bringing back an icon of the god from that sacred site was one way</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_080.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 76%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">46 </span>This administrative territorial system should be distinguished from the <i>Pu </i>of the postal system as well as from the <i>Pu </i>of the city ward system.

This song clearly identifies the early alliance between the four great surnames of Zhu, Wu, Yu, and Chen, and praises their efforts in digging the Mulan irrigation canal in the Song dynasty. The song goes on to sing of how successful their descendants have been in attaining success in examinations and official positions, and how high ranking representatives of each lineage have intermarried. Then the song relates the devastation of the Ming-Qing transition, and the miraculous appearance of the name of Xuantian shangdi in the form of a swarm of bees on a tree. An Imperial Censor from the Zhu lin- eage donated the land where the tree stood for the temple, and other Zhu and Wu lineage members contributed funds for its construction. The visit to Wudangshan to present incense (and bring back charged incense to the new temple) is described, complete with the three times the incense fire went out, to test the sincerity of the worshippers. The god pacified the Huangshi region and drove out the demons and ghosts of the dead left over from the pirate invasions. At that point, a new temple committee was formed out of three lineages, and a pact was made to recarve the god’s statue once every ten years. On these occasions the god would be carried in a great procession (the gazet- teer describes current processions in elaborate detail). The song relates that these customs were maintained into the Qing dynasty, and that leadership continued to come from the three lineage alliance, although later only the Zhu and Wu lineages continued donations.

The song goes on to recount the renovations to the temple in the Kangxi (1662–1722) and Qian- long periods (1736–95), and to detail the many miracles carried out by the god. The remainder of the song describes over a dozen occasions when various District Magistrates had come in solemn processions, dressed in mourning, to pray to the god for rain. These successful interventions of the gods were rewarded with official rites of thanks- giving, inscribed plaques and testimonials. The gazetteer also includes a Republican period narrative poem, describing the visit of a District Magistrate to the temple to pray for rain in 1943.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Currently, the Beichengong Xuantian shangdi goes on procession every three years to the Guchenggong temple at the opposite end of Huangshi town. It is difficult to say when this connection was made with Guchenggong, but inscriptions in that temple indicate a great deal of activity in the 1730’s, just at the time when the thirty-six village alliance of Lingyun Temple on Mt. Hu was forming. Perhaps we can see these alliances as counter-balancing forces, the one representing the powerful gentry of Huangshi, the other the poorer villages along the edge of Mt. Hu, mostly beyond the reach of the Mulan irrigation system. These hillside villages would become one of the strongholds of the white and black banner alliances in the late Qing, and later of Republican period rebel leaders.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">The pirate invasions that led to the founding of the Beichengong were the result of many factors, including the physical proximity to the sea of the towns and villages of the irrigated plain, the relative wealth of the literati lineages of the region, and the ban on overseas trade instituted by the Ming court (partially in response to these raids). These raids left a deep impression on local society and folk customs.

Lin had already achieved a reputation as a local sage when the pirates struck Putian city. They were careful to spare his house in the sacking of the city. In the aftermath of these raids, Lin mobilized his followers to retrieve and bury thousands of corpses, and tended to the cremation of many thousands more, per- forming rites for the deliverance of their souls. These actions helped secure Lin considerable local respect and support which helped shield him from accusations of heterodoxy. His movement began to build temples in the late 1590s, in which Lin was deified as the god Xiawuni <span class="s8">夏 午 尼 </span>(parallel to Confucius, Laozi, and Shakyamuni Buddha). Over sixty temples were built within two decades of his death in 1598 (Dean 1998:134).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Three in One movement was dedicated to rebuilding the moral foundations of local community in Putian and Xianyou, in the wake of the disruptions of the pirate raids. The movement provided an avenue for the active performance of morality, through study of the Confu- cian classics, self-cultivation in the Nine Stages of the Heart Method of Daoist inner alchemy and Buddhist meditation, and the performance</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">112 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">of rituals seeking to re-impose cosmic harmony on a troubled time. The movement was also committed to charity, good works, and moral out- reach. The Three in One divided into several sects, such as the Wuben<span class="s8">悟本</span>, which was revived in the late Qing by Chen Zhida and Liang Puyao <span class="s8">梁普耀</span>, the Mingxia <span class="s8">明夏 </span>(founded by disciple Lin Zhenming<span class="s8">林貞明</span>), and the Sanyi <span class="s8">三一 </span>sects. The Wuben emphasizes daily rites of offering and scripture recitation (<i>wen daochang </i><span class="s8">文道場</span>), self- cultivation and scripture exegesis while the Mingxia and Sanyi sects emphasize ritual performance (<i>wu daochang </i><span class="s8">武道場</span>). Many of the temples of the Three in One in Putian have statues of Zhang Sanfeng<span class="s8">張三峰 </span>and Zhuo Wanchun <span class="s8">卓晚春</span>, Daoist figures who influenced Lin Zhao’en in his decision to renounce the official examinations and pur- sue self cultivation and inner alchemy. Other figures often represented in Three in One temples include the Four Attendants (Lu Wenhui<span class="s8">盧文輝</span>, Zhang Hongdu <span class="s8">張洪都</span>, Lin Zhijing <span class="s8">林至敬 </span>(Lin Zhenming<span class="s8">林貞明</span>), and Zhu Fengshi <span class="s8">朱逢時)</span>.

This move affected nearly half of the villages of Putian (but only a far smaller number of those in the irrigated plain). This forced resettlement led to a decline of the sea dikes, which collapsed, flooding portions of the irrigated plain all the way to Putian city in 1664. The line of the coastal evacuation is indicated on the map of the <i>Qing coastal evacuation</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The coastal evacuations of the early Qing extended the period of disruption initiated by the pirate invasions of the 1560’s. According to Yu Yang’s <i>Record of the Incidents in Pu[tian]</i>:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Our county is hemmed in by mountains, extensive in the plains, and stretches out into the sea. In the mountains there is one village every several <i>li </i>and each village may have only a few families. In the plains, residents live in close proximity, distributed like stars in the sky or pieces on a chessboard. The larger [villages] may have several hundred families, and the smaller ones several hundred people. This is also the case on the coast . . . One surname may have two or three thousand adult males, and one village one or two thousand people. Since the pirates created distur- bance for ten years, there were considerable losses in population. In the roughly one hundred years of peace between 1562 and 1644, the num- bers increased. There is no knowing about other [places], but in Xialin, which is my mother’s natal village and so I visited there often, (and) each year as many as several dozen new sons were reported. If one surname was like this, the situation in other surnames can also be imagined. Thus in our locality the population has never increased at the rate in did in the Chongzhen <span class="s18">崇楨 </span>period. After the change of dynasty . . . as soon as the official troops came out, be it to do battle or to pacify forts, not even a chicken or a pig remained in the villages. It is estimated that more than half the populace died in this period. In the autumn of 1663, the coastal evacuation order was issued. Those who survived on the coast fled and roamed about. All over was heard the mournful call of wild geese. It was impossible to put things in order. Moreover, in 1664 and 1664, there were the disasters of flood and drought, and innumerable service levies were imposed simultaneously. Among those within the boundaries [of the evacuation], some died fulfilling the service levies, some of hunger, and some from tax pressures. It came to the point where there were lanes with no residents and roads on which on one walked. (cited in Zheng, 2001:211–212, trans. M. Szonyi).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Given these disruptions, it is not surprising that more and more lin- eages transformed into contractual lineages. Even some lineages, such as the Cai of Dongsha in Putian, who had managed to restore a hier- archical control-subordination lineage after the coastal evacuation, gradually gave way in the Yongzheng <span class="s8">雍正 </span>(1723–1735) period to a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 115</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">contractual lineage. A passage in the <i>Jin’nan Caishi zupu </i>[<i>(Putian) Jin’nan Cai lineage genealo</i>gy] of 1730 states:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">In his life [great-grandfather Zhong] often accomplished things when he was roused to do so. In the Yongzheng period, our lineage had many troubles, such that the sacrificial property was wasted and diminished, and as for the annual sacrifice to the ancestors of the descent-line, even if it was not cut off, it hung on by only a thread. No one who had a heart was not worried. One day [Zhong] said to the lineage members: “Now it is extremely urgent that we recover the sacrificial property. I propose that every household which is willing should contribute one picul of grain. This can be used to recover some of the sacrificial land, and the members of these households may participate in the sacrifice. Those who are unable [to pay] will surely be ashamed that they do not participate in the sacrifice, and will be encouraged to try to do so.” Lin- eage uncle Yizuo said, “This will be difficult. [The households of the lin- eage members] are not equally wealthy, nor are they all of equal size. If you are indeed able to persuade fifty households, then I will give you 3,000 cash to participate in the sacrifices. If you are unable to do so, they you must pay me twice this amount.” [Zhong] said, “If you really mean this, we should draw up a contract.” So lineage uncles Jiansou, Tianren, Xiezhen, and others agreed to serve together as guarantors [for the contract] which was given to great-grandfather, and the outcome awaited. Great-grandfather used his righteousness to move people, and more than sixty names wanted to contribute. Unfortunately, in that year the fall harvest was disappointing, and only 60 percent of them actually paid. [Zhong] spent many days and much energy, but he did not reach his goal. He bravely decided that he would pay on behalf of each of the lineage members, one after the other, allowing them to repay him and clear their debt as they could after this, the accumulated [funds] were</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">gradually revived, first by a few, then by many, and finally the complete</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">[amount was raised]. (cited in Zheng, 2001:226, trans. M. Szonyi).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The decline of the Cai hierarchical lineage during this period was related to the weakness of the gentry stratum following the disrup- tions of the Qing takeover and the coastal evacuations. The Cai lineage would revive its former glory once again later in the Qianlong period (1736–95). In fact, many residentially concentrated lineages expanded during the 18th century. There was no teleological impulse moving all lineages towards a contractual model. Many regrouped into control- subordination lineages, with hierarchical structures of power, manage- rial elites, and tenant farmers. Nevertheless, the coastal evacuation left profound psychic scars on the collective memory of the inhabitants of the Putian plains. These memories are ritually re-enacted every three years, when a procession from the walled fort of Puxi visits the City</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">116 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">God of Hanjiang to pay respects to their own god, who they moved for safekeeping prior to the coastal evacuation. Later, the god refused to return, preferring to preside over the rapid growth of the commercial town. Currently, the villages that were gradually reclaimed after the lifting of the coastal evacuation tend to have weaker lineages and more varied kinds of temples and temple networks than the more estab- lished villages of the interior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Single Whip tax reforms and Qing tax reforms</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, households were registered by occupation and by residence within the <i>lijia </i>system. Both forms of reg- istration entailed various kinds of taxation and corvée labor. As Zheng (2001) and Szonyi (2002) have shown, there were a high proportion of military households registered in Fujan, up to a third of the total population. As state control over the household registration system declined, lineages with military registration developed rapidly in order to work out their own solutions to the military service requirements (which could be paid for in cash). As for the <i>lijia </i>system, in which larger lineages and households were singled out to be <i>Lishou </i><span class="s8">里首 </span>(heads of the hundred families of the <i>Li sub-canton</i>) and <i>Jiashou </i><span class="s8">甲首 </span>(heads of the ten family units), He Qiaoyuan <span class="s8">何喬遠 </span>noted in 1627 that:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">The service levy obligations of the <i>lijia </i>households originally con- sisted only of pressing for tax payment and assembling labor for public works. Later they became responsible for meeting various government expenses. They had to take care of the [official] sacrificial expenses, the Village Drinking ritual, and the ceremony of Welcoming the Spring, for example. Gradually this extended to paying all kinds of miscellaneous personal expenses of the officials. All kinds of expenses appeared for which there was no basis. As soon as a single document was issued, there was immediately no way to avoid it. Moreover, the secretaries and the <i>yamen </i>runners also demanded bribes and money in this manner. The <i>lijia </i>households were pushed into bankruptcy. (<i>Minshu </i><span class="s18">閩 書 </span>, j. 39, cited in Zheng, 2001: 291, trans. M. Szonyi).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In theory, every ten years Yellow Registers were supposed to have been compiled to select and rotate the positions of <i>Li </i>and <i>Jia </i>heads. But people devised endlessly creative means to conceal the size of their families, to the point that the number of households diminished dras- tically, and the numbers of <i>Li </i>and <i>Jia </i>had to be decreased. In response, by the Chenghua <span class="s8">成 化 </span>and Hongzhi <span class="s8">弘 治 </span>reign periods (1465–1505),</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 117</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">a fixed tax and service levy was assigned to the current <i>lijia </i>house- holds. The state stopped trying to assess changing populations and property holdings. The <i>Li </i>and <i>Jia </i>head households gradually became permanent, hereditary positions. As Zheng Ji pointed out in his <i>Pref- ace to the New Lijia Registers</i>:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">This year my younger brother prepared to serve as <i>li </i>head (<i>lizhang </i><span class="s18">里長</span>). He assembled all those who were involved in the matter, so they could devote themselves wholeheartedly to thinking things over. They agreed that, in order to meet the exactions on schedule, they should gather and prepare this register. All of the obligations from [the ceremonies on] the Emperor’s Birthday and the Village Drinking ceremony down to the most trivial of corvée services, and the various troublesome exactions, have been assessed and classified by type Altogether, the total annual</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">expenses are just under 500 taels. So the annual obligations of each <i>jia </i>come to between twenty and thirty taels, only one-seventh or one-eighth of the amount that used to have to be paid [when the obligations were distributed by rotation]. After the register was compiled, it was presented to the <i>yamen </i><span class="s18">衙門</span>. The one hundred and forty households of this <i>li </i>have collectively vowed to uphold it, so it will become the rule by which the annual exactions are met. (<i>Dongyuan wenji </i><span class="s18">東園文集</span>, j. 9, 7b–9b, cited in Zheng 2001:293, trans. M. Szonyi).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Zheng Ji’s brother was in effect offering his services as a tax farmer, and at the same time instituting fixed, hereditary responsibilities for the individual households in the <i>lijia </i>unit. “Once the <i>lijia </i>registers had become merely formulaic and <i>lijia </i>obligations fixed, when a household estate was divided, the descendants generally did not register as separate households, but rather collectively retained the original <i>lijia </i>registra- tion. That is, the descendants inherited and fulfilled the obligations of this registration collectively. The effect was that, after the mid-Ming, <i>lijia </i>registration became basically synonymous with lineage organization. Each <i>jia </i>simply represented a single lineage.” (Zheng, 2001:295). Tax farming had become a prerogative of the dominant lineage leaders within  the  <i>lijia </i>(sub-canton  tax  units).  This  led  to  increasing  class polarization.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Already in the mid-Ming, efforts known as the Single Whip tax reforms were underway to commute the complex tax system and hered- itary service obligations of the early Ming into a cash standard (Huang 1974:295–305). There were many consequences to these actions, espe- cially the decline of local government funding (since tax in cash was more readily absorbed by the central government) and, as a result, the downloading of responsibility for maintenance of local infrastructure</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">118 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">to local gentry, lineages, and temple networks (since corvée labor was no longer provided to the local government, and labor had to be paid for with limited cash resources).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">This process took many decades, and was only completed in the early Qing dynasty. By the Qing, the very basis of taxation had shifted away from the <i>lijia </i>system to a tax on registered household popula- tion and on registered plots of land. However, since the registers no longer accurately reflected household populations (since many divided households were registered under a single <i>lijia </i>household registration account), officials attempted to distribute the tax burden more or less equally to each <i>li </i>sub-canton. As part of that process, many local offi- cials in Fujian called for a policy of “allocating tax households to the descent line”, or in other words, they continually sought to assign the responsibility for tax collection to the lineage heads.<span class="s9">48</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: -41pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;">The Putian plain in the Qing: lineages, temples, and commercial associations</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Vermeer (1990) argued that the Xinghua region went into a pronounced decline in the late Ming and Qing dynasties. His assessment is based on the declining rate of success of Putian scholars in the imperial examinations over the Qing dynasty, even though he notes that the decline in numbers had much to do with new quotas on examination candidates imposed on the region.<span class="s9">49 </span>However, many other indicators suggest that Putian prospered over the Qing dynasty.

Vermeer (1990) estimates the that between 1600 and 1750, the Lin, Chen and Huang surname groups made up 42 percent or 149 or the 353 <i>Gongshen </i><span class="s11">貢生 </span>(County Graduates) listed in the <i>(Qianlong) Putian xianzhi</i>, 40 percent, or 169 of the 445 <i>Juren </i><span class="s11">舉人 </span>(Provincial Graduates) from the same period, and 38 percent, or 35 out of the 115 <i>Jinshi </i>of that period. He points out however, that these surname groups made up a large proportion of the population of Putian during the Ming, and that they were divided into many different lines and branches.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 119</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">clusion that “in the 17th and 18th century Pu-t’ien did not have domi- nant or particularly powerful lineages any more” (Vermeer, 1990:155) is questionable. Several strong lineages maintained ancestral halls in different villages of the Putian plains, including the Chen of Dongyang village, who built an enormous household compound with scores of interlocking courtyards which can still be visited in that village. Their 1817 lineage genealogy includes prefaces dating to Shaosheng 4 (1097) in the Northern Song, the Yuan, and several from the Ming (includ- ing prefaces dated Yongle 18 (1420), Tianshun 2 (1458), and Wanli 8 (1580). However, after the attacks on Putian the lineage genealo- gies were lost and had to be reconstructed with the assistance of other branches of the lineage living elsewhere (Dongsha). Additional pref- aces dated Kangxi 45 (1706) and Qianlong 23 (1758), reveal that the lineage had re-established its genealogy and rebuilt and expanded its ancestral hall, which had originally been built in Yongle 15 (1417). The hall was expanded in Chenghua 6 (1470), and restored twice dur- ing the Kangxi period (in 1664 and again in 1681). Additional repairs were made in 1806. This was the home of the <i>jinshi </i>Chen Chiyang<span class="s8">陳池養 </span>(1788–1859), who oversaw the system-wide repairs to all of the major irrigation systems of the Putian plains over three decades from the 1820s through the 1840s.

Many of their lands were farmed by tenant farmers and the taxes were gathered by local managers. The lineage halls and their management elites inside Putian city controlled over half the land on the Putian plain by the end of the Qing.<span class="s9">51 </span>The large-scale development of corporately owned lineage land transformed many lineages into profit-driven economic entities, with considerable internal economic differentiation, and highly var- iegated business activities.

Local society was too complex, fluid, and interconnected to allow it to be frozen into a set relationship with the state. Thus many members of the same lineage scattered to other areas, joining the tax registration of other “lineages”, while the traditional ideal of a localized lineage co-extensive with the (single- surname) village became less and less common. The lineages scattered, and many former localized lineage centers turned into absentee land- lord corporations. Larger, higher level lineages formed, and some of these further transformed into joint-stock corporations, featuring the circulation of shares beyond the limits of a single lineage. This led to the formation of mixed forms of collective ownership, merging the lineage with other village organizations such as temples or money-shar- ing societies watched over by a particular god (<i>shenminghui </i><span class="s8">神明會</span>). As stated by Zheng (2001:327), “by the Ming Qing period, family lin- eage organization had already transcended the limitations of consan- guinal  kinship  relations  and  had  incorporated  other  organizational principles capable of adapting to other social relations.”<span class="s9">53 </span>While some villages retained strong, single lineages,<span class="s9">54 </span>in more and more commu- nities the lineage was stretched thin and ultimately mutated, merging into territorial ritual alliances.

Our survey notes the location of over 120 ancestral halls currently found in villages across the plain, and other historical references allow us to identify the former locations of twenty to thirty other ancestral halls. This suggests that there were lineage halls in about one fifth of the villages on the Putian plains. <i>Map 10: Ancestral Halls: including Song and Ming sites </i>(see <i>Color Plates</i>) shows the locations of these halls. This is a difficult map to read or interpret, and requires some com- mentary. Over 500 villages marked in light blue did not report the presence of an ancestral hall. Villages marked with a red dot reported one ancestral hall. Villages that reported two or more halls are marked with a red triangle. Villages that reported that their ancestral halls had been torn down or converted into warehouses, or offices of the agri- cultural collective, or <i>laorenhui </i><span class="s8">老人會 (</span>associations for the elderly), are marked with a red cross. A large red circle indicates the site of a Ming lineage hall, and a large red diamond the site of a Song ancestral hall or major lineage.<span class="s9">55</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The pattern of distribution of ancestral halls is affected by many variables, and is quite uneven. Many of these halls would have been targets of attack after the establishment of the Peoples Republic in 1949, and especially during the Cultural Revolution. Some ancestral halls, though by no means all, have survived from the Song and Ming in early villages where a particular lineage still lives. Other halls may have been built over the Ming and Qing dynasties to celebrate the success of a lineage member in the imperial exams, or when a lineage decided to form new branch organizations. One can still detect a con- centration of lineage halls around Huangshi town on the southern irri- gated plain, the site of the ancestral villages of the Fourteen Surnames in the Song dynasty.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Although ancestral halls are not found in most villages, almost every village on the Putian plain has one or more <i>gucuo </i><span class="s8">古厝 </span>(ancestral old homes), where limited ancestral worship can take place. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of villagers still identify themselves in terms of lineage, and are ritually active to varying extents in different levels of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_090.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">55 <span class="s7">Note that some of these villages no longer have lineage halls.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">124 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">ancestral worship (in the home through offerings of rice and incense to immediate ancestors, in offerings presented in the <i>gucuo </i>to more remote ancestors, and in more elaborate seasonal sacrifices held in ancestral halls in their own villages where these exist to the founding Fujian ancestors and a long succession of ancestors).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, the scarcity of active ancestral halls calls for further explanation. Only a handful of these halls are now called <i>jiamiao </i><span class="s8">家廟 </span>(family temple), a term originally used for the ancestral ritual preroga- tives of high officials, even though we have seen that there were more than enough officials produced by the villages of the Putian plains in the Song and Ming to generate a large number of such halls. If the assigning of tax farming responsibilities to the local lineages under the revised <i>lijia </i>taxation system in the mid-Ming had led to the fixing in place of the lineages as an intermediary, mediating and controlling strata between State and society (as envisioned in Freedman’s (1970) vision of the Chinese lineage), then one would expect the lineage halls to dominate the villages of the Putian plain. By comparison, in the Fuzhou area studied by Szonyi (2002) temples often rival the lineage halls in grandeur, but the latter are still the most impressive local structures in the villages. In the Pearl River delta studied by Faure (2007) lineage halls are usually the pre-eminent structures found in the villages. By contrast, on the Putian plain we find lineage expressed primarily through temple ritual, with different lineages represented by different deities, and mixed surname groups also represented by the cult of a particular god in a multi-god temple. These village temples greatly outnumber lineage halls, and the higher order temples are the most magnificent building complexes on the plain.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Many factors led to this situation. The pirate invasions of the 1550s and 1560s, the Qing Manchu invasion and the Zheng Chenggong counterattacks of the 1640s, along with the coastal evacuation from 1660 to 1680 all added up to over a hundred years of disruption of local society. The traces of these traumatic events can still be seen in the villages “beyond the limit”, where powerful lineages are relatively rare. Nonetheless, local society gradually regrouped, and coastal trade resumed in the 17th century and grew in the 18th and early 19th cen- tury (Ng 1990). Many powerful lineages consolidated their hold on specific villages and in some cases, on clusters of villages, in the mid- Qing. Overall however, despite, or perhaps in response to, a sustained period of relative prosperity in the mid to late Qing, the lineage under- went significant integration with local territorial temple networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 125</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One of the most important sources of pressure on village life and lineage organization was the surge in population over the Ming and especially in the mid to late Qing. Population figures for Putian are notoriously suspect (because of their connection with frequently and ingeniously evaded taxes).</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-bottom:

The county was divided into four urban zones and 31 <i>li </i>sub-cantons, which were fur- ther divided into 294 <i>tu</i>, each of which was supposed to have had 110 households. However, by Jingtai 3 (1452) the number of registered households had dropped to 36,009, with the overall population given as 102,419. This sharp decline appears to have been the result of efforts to evade the demands of the <i>lijia </i>tax system, along with other tax and corvée requirements of the early Ming. Figures for Hongzhi 5 (1492) are 26,941 households with 165,480 individuals. Sixty years later, in Jiajing 31 (1552), the figures are 25,851 households with 166,730 indi- viduals. The population decline caused by the capture of Putian city in 1562 is revealed in Jiajing 41 (1562), where 25,855 households are reported with only 147,316 individuals, a sharp drop of almost 20,000 people in ten years time. Figures from Wanli 40 (1612) show little improvement, with 25,855 households with 148,756 individuals.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Early Qing figures show only 60,886 “individuals” registered for the new head tax registered in 1661, rising slightly to 71,750 in Qianlong 20 (1756). These figures represent the change from the <i>lijia </i>system of tax on population to the later Qing system of tax on landholdings reg-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">126 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">istered under the name of an individual. In fact, the “individual” was often a lineage which was responsible for raising the required tax on the account. There was clearly rapid and sustained population growth over the mid to late Qing, for in the Daoguang 9 (1829) tax roles there is a registration figure of 84,263 households with 394,997 individu- als. These much higher population figures were also the result of the imposition of a <i>baojia </i>mutual security system on the villages of Putian, and thus represent a more up to date survey of local conditions. The population rose very rapidly in the Republican period, to 617,753 in 1937, and then to 691,525 in 1949. By 1990 the population had more than doubled, rising to 1,508,210. Population growth led to consider- able emigration from Putian to Southeast Asia in the late 19th century. Lineages such as the Huang of Shiting at this time began to change into a transnational corporation (see Chapters 8 and 9 below).</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Another fundamental reason for the transformation of the lineage</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">form in the Putian plains over this period has to do with the nature of the local irrigation system. The system is extraordinarily complex and interconnected. Salt water enters deep into the plain on the rising tide, pushing up the Mulan river to the Mulan Weir, located southwest of Putian city. The Weir diverts fresh water descending from the moun- tains into the Southern and Northern Irrigated plains. Fresh water also follows the retreat of brackish seawater back into the Xinghua bay during low tide. Sluice gates situated in several points along the banks of the Mulan river are opened and closed twice daily in time with the tides of the sea. Thus for several hours of the day, the irrigation chan- nels function as temporary reservoirs. Water is released from these temporary reservoirs during low tide. Such a system requires coopera- tion and maintenance all along the length of its major channels and secondary and tertiary canals, and at each of its sluice gates. This irri- gation system is also extremely sensitive to excess rainfall and to surg- ing tides brought on by storms or typhoons. There are frequent floods along many sections of the irrigation system, which in fact restore some nutrients to the soil if they are not too long lasting or extreme. Thus the system had to be well coordinated enough to respond rap- idly to changing weather conditions—from typhoons to floods—and to take systemic decisions about responses to changing conditions. This required the development of a highly inter-connected local level management system, based in the higher order temples composed of multiple ritual alliances. This kind of coordination would be difficult for localized lineages to achieve.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 127</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Mulan irrigation system, along with the Yanshou Weir and the Shihua Weir <span class="s8">使華陂 </span>on the Yanshou river, and the Taiping Weir and the Nan’an Weir on the Qiulu river, were all founded with state sup- port in the Tang and Song. Over time, the trend turned to the institu- tionalization of local control over and management of irrigation, due to the very nature of the system. State input was required periodically for the linking together of many locally initiated reclamation projects into a new dike along the river banks or on the seacoast. State inter- vention was also needed to respond to floods that would destroy dikes or damage weirs, or to attempt to balance out competing demands over water rights by villages within the irrigated plains during times of drought, or to punish the theft of water by various groups and to attempt to mediate demands and regulate water distribution as equi- tably as possible. But even at the start of the Mulan irrigation system in the Song, the role of the Fourteen Surnames shows the involvement of local social groups, whatever their actual status may have been at the time.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Different kinds of irrigation systems under different ecological con- ditions have distinct impacts on local social organization. Thus the high degree of interconnectedness of the Putian irrigated plain led to the spread of a network of ritual alliances rather than to the domina- tion of different lineages over specific parcels of land.<span class="s9">56 </span>In an expand- ing delta such as the Pearl River delta studied by Faure (2007), the natural process of formation of sandy islets within the delta provided the perfect opportunity for local groups (many of whom were origi- nally of Dan origin) to claim these lands in the name of a lineage and to adopt the lineage form in order to achieve legitimacy from the state and the official registration of their land claims. Thus the perfect mar- riage of state Confucian ideology and local needs for official recogni- tion led to a “Confucianization” of local society. Whether this meant that the local temple system became insignificant under the spread of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="64" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_093.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 38pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">56 <span class="s7">Faure (2007) has suggested that the ritual networks of the Putian plains arose in response to the need to maintain the irrigation system. However, his view that these alliances were quite large (equal to a xiang) is not fully borne out by the survey, which finds that many of the alliances are single villages. Of course, the latter may have been isolated elements between larger alliances. In general, the point here is that the entire plain developed these alliances due to the systemic complexity of their interrelations, and that this also required the elaboration of new forms of ritual and new forms of local power.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">128 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the lineage form is another question which requires further study (see Liu 1995).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Similarly, the riverine irrigation systems of Shanxi and Henan in northern central China display very different ecological constraints (Bai Erheng, Lang Keli and Wei Peixin, 2003; Dong Xiaoping and Lang Keli, 2003). In these systems, water is increasingly limited, and very carefully distributed and rationed. This requires quite strict regulations with considerable state intervention and policing to ensure compli- ance. Sometimes unsustainable contradictions and pressures arise from new commercial demands on water for the milling of grain on the one hand, and dwindling water supply and an effort to achieve equitable distribution on the part of the state on the other. The inte- gration of local society into the control functions of the state and the emphasis on morality, compliance, and orthodoxy are prominent fea- tures of such irrigation systems. At the same time, scarcity of water leads to a profound proliferation of cults of water gods and rain mak- ing deities.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">These irrigation systems differ again from those of Taiwan, which</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">for the most part involve water falling rapidly from high mountains into a fairly thin coastal plain and out to the sea. The late date of the colonization and development of Taiwan, in the context of a frontier immigrant society with weak lineages and stronger sub-ethnic identi- fication via temple cults brought from different points in Fujian and Guangdong led to the development of distinct interactions between ecological constraints and social formations. The irrigation systems around the lakes of the Jiangnan region are again another ecological set of conditions. Each of these cases brings together a different mix of elements of state control, ecological constraints, social formations, and historical conditions. In each case, geography plays a strongly con- straining (and enabling), if not determining, factor in the evolution of local social forms and in constraining the relations of state and society. Other cultural, social and historical factors ensure indeterminacy and evoke creative local innovations.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Qing lineages in the irrigated Putian plain underwent many trans-</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">formations. Zheng Zhenman (2001) has suggested a broad tendency of change from what he terms inheritance lineages in the Song, to con- trol-subordination lineages in the Ming, to contractual lineages in the Qing. Of course, he points out that all three kinds of lineages co-existed at any one period. Moreover, he argues that any one lineage is likely to transform over time into these different categories as a communitarian</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 129</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">style lineage with collective property, work, and distribution of goods gradually changes into a control-subordination lineage, either through the accumulation of a lineage estate and the growth of a managerial elite, or through the impact of outside success in the examination sys- tem or in the merchant realm. Finally, these powerful lineages often found it irresistible to diversify, opening themselves to capitalist forces and turning into joint-stock corporations in which outsiders (in terms of kinship) could buy shares. Zheng goes on to show that contractual lineages could transform back into control-subordination lineages, and that under some circumstances, these too could transform back into inheritance lineages. His transformative structural model extends below the level of the lineage all the way to the nuclear family, with important implications for ritual activity at each level. The point we seek to emphasize here is that the lineages of Putian were constantly changing, in relation to classical models, in relation to one another and to external forces of the state (examinations) and the market, and internally over time. Particularly in certain areas such as the <i>jiewai </i>vil- lages that suffered evacuation in the early Qing, the tendency was for the contractual lineage model to dominate in the rebuilding of local society, as different groups fought over land rights and resources.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">But even in the established, long settled villages of the inner Putian</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">plain, other forces led to a weakening of the dominant lineage model. These included the movement of many lineage elites into Putian city in the high Qing, leaving their village centers open to more fluid for- mations based in temple committees. As more lineages diversified into merchant activity in the late Qing, more and more adopted in sons to send to Southeast Asia on a sink or swim speculative model of trans-national networking. The declining number of <i>Jinshi </i>and <i>Juren </i>in Qing Putian has been cited as an indication of the decline of the region over the Qing dynasty (Vermeer 1990), but this could be taken to imply that attaining official office was the only significant sign of suc- cess. Increasing population, diversification of lineage activities, rising merchant activity including a concentration on coastal shipping and smuggling, along with a wide range of local avenues to pursue Confu- cian values in everyday life (such as the Three in One), all contributed to a period of sustained growth on the Putian plains. At the same time, the spread of literacy, along with decreasing chances for official positions, led many local literati to turn their interests and their efforts towards local society. The trend towards localism in certain schools of Qing Confucian practical statecraft teaching also encouraged a closer</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">130 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">integration of local elites and local society.<span class="s9">57 </span>The temple networks of the regional ritual alliances became an important venue where edu- cated elites could develop their talents and expand their connections. These temple committees also doubled as chambers of commerce, and many <i>shenminghui </i><span class="s8">神 明 會 </span>(loan associations guaranteed by oaths to the gods) formed within them. In the high Qing, these regional temple networks would have maintained intimate links with the great temples within Putian City, including the City God temple, whose grand pro- cession was a major event in local cultural life.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">The following image of Putian city is taken from the (Qianlong) <i>Putian xianzhi</i>. Note the walls around the city, with the four direc- tional gates, and the irrigation canals running along the sides and through the center of the city. Inside the city walls, one sees rep- resented government offices, Confucian schools, public granaries, military barracks, the Chenghuangmiao <span class="s8">城隍廟 </span>(City God temple), the centers of the Buddhist and Daoist Supervision Offices (the Yong- fusi <span class="s8">永福寺 </span>and the Wanshougong <span class="s8">萬壽宮 </span>respectively), the temple to Mazu <span class="s8">媽祖 </span>or Tianhou <span class="s8">天后</span>, the Wenfenggong <span class="s8">文峰宮</span>, and other temples and monasteries, including the great Buddhist Guanghuasi<span class="s8">廣化寺 </span>outside the city walls. Notice also the Wushishan <span class="s8">烏石山 </span>hill at the north of the city. Here Lin Zhao’en established his Zongkong- tang <span class="s8">宗孔堂 </span>in the late Ming to spread his Three in One teachings.

In the Putian plains, many of the larger control-subordination lineages of the gradually transformed into contractual lineages in the mid to late Qing. These lineages resembled joint stock corporations. Membership could be obtained by the purchase of shares in the lineage corpora- tion. Similar commercialization can be seen in the ritual associations as well. Several contracts for purchase of membership in a <i>shê </i>ritual association survive from late Qing Putian.

In 1739, the <span class="s8">興安會館 </span>Xingan Huiguan (commercial association) was established, and their first act was to build a new Tianhou temple in Hanjiang. This was a fairly loosely organized association, made up of many different trades all gathered together under the protection of the goddess Mazu. Two inscriptions still standing in the temple, dated 1750 and 1753, show that one group of forty shipping merchants had formed a god association called the <i>Dongouhui </i>and invested in three rental properties to raise funds for sacrificial rites. Every year eight <i>shanghao </i><span class="s8">商號 </span>(companies) took charge of the sacrifices in a five year rotation cycle. Another group of twenty-four prosperous merchants formed a god association simply called the <i>xiangdeng hui </i><span class="s8">香燈會 </span>(incense and oil lamp association), which also kept two rental prop- erties which brought in 26,000 cash each year.

According to a stele still in the temple which officially prohibits a neighboring kiln from polluting the temple, Hanjiang was a major commercial port, and much of the business of the town was carried out inside the Tianhou temple. The Huiguan consisted of an association of ten trades. They maintained the temple and paid for Buddhist monks to carry out ritu- als. The temple was hugely popular with the local people, who came regularly seeking the blessings of the goddess. Important visiting offi- cials came to present incense to the goddess, and were received by the leaders of the commercial association.<span class="s9">60</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Xingan Huiguan continued to grow in power through the 19th century, and was involved in irrigation projects, the training of <i>tuan- lian </i>self-defense troops, and the building of temples. In 1870, one Huang Bangjie <span class="s8">黃 邦 杰 </span>proposed to restore the temple and establish a new temple committee, with the funding coming from “profits on the sale of goods”. The committee included forty different <i>shanghao </i>com- panies, each of whom contributed different amounts from a thousand to over five million cash, depending on their sales. This was no longer a system of voluntary contributions, but a territorial temple system with established, fixed rates of mandatory contributions. As the still extant stele in the Hanjiang Tianhou Temple from 1876 states, “The merchants of Putian lead the way in shipping throughout the Wu Yue area (Southeast China), and in their buying and selling, importing and exporting, they all gather in Hanjiang.

Another feature of sustained economic security was a rapid increase in population, leading to the founding of many new villages at the end of the Qing (see <i>Map 9: Village Foundation Date by Dynasty </i>in the <i>Color Plates</i>). Within older villages, one notes the spreading out of lineages into mixed-surname neighborhoods and their increasingly complex participation in multi- god temple cults.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The High Qing marks a turning point in court attitudes towards lay initiatory religious movements. Increasing suspicion and pressure from the court frequently led to persecutions which in turn led to rebellions. A lay Buddhist <i>zhaijiao </i><span class="s8">齋 醮 </span>rebellion in northern Fujian was put down in 1748 (Seiwert: 2003:251). Inside Putian, the Three in One and other similar groups were forced to go underground for sev- eral decades during the Qianlong period (1736–95). During this time, many Three in One temples changed their names from <i>Tang </i><span class="s8">堂 </span>(Hall) to <i>Shuyuan </i><span class="s8">書 院 </span>(Academy) to avoid official suspicion. Nonetheless, the groundwork was laid for the rapid expansion of these networks at the end of the Qing.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Qianlong period was also a turning point in court attitudes</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">towards Daoism, with the Celestial Masters of Longhushan being demoted and eventually (in the Daoguang period) being refused access to the court. There appears to have been a growing suspicion of the close relationship between Daoist ritual masters and local ritual alli- ances. Despite this attitude, this period was a long, prosperous, and secure era, and local temples were built in large numbers in the Putian plains.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One fairly new phenomenon beginning in the 18th century was the formation of higher order lineages combining several residentially dis-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_098.png"/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">61 </span>Chongxiu Xingan huiguan beiji <span class="s11">重 修 興 安 會 館 碑 記 </span><span class="s7">(</span>Stele recording the repair of the Xingan Commercial Association<span class="s7">), in Dean and Zheng, </span>Epigraphical Materials, <span class="s7">1995: No. 296, pp. 331–333.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 135</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">persed lineages of the same surname.<span class="s9">62 </span>For example, the <i>Corporate Register of the Great Descent Hall of the Huang of Xianxi </i>(1934) refers to the construction of this hall in 1734, and states:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Among us of the Huang surname in Xianyou, some have come from the provincial capital, some arrived from Putian, some have moved from Quanzhou. But, simply speaking, all of us originated in Jiangxi [in Hubei]. So, based on the imperative to treat kin as kin, we have con- structed a Great Descent-Line Hall in the county town, to sacrifice to (Huang) Yuanfang, the Prefect of Jinjiang Prefecture in the Jin period; (Huang) Shougong, a respected man of his prefecture in the Jin; (Huang) An, the prefect of Guizhou <span class="s18">貴 州 </span>, enfeoffed as state-establishing Duke in the Tang, and Investigating Censor (Huang) Tao. Beneath them are installed ancestral tablets according to contributions. Property has been purchased for the annual sacrifices. This hall is known as the Hall of Respectful Inheritance (Jingchengtang), to reflect the deep significance of respecting the ancestors and uniting the descent-line. (Zheng, 2001: 318–19, trans. M. Szonyi).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">By 1933 this hall contained 542 ancestral tablets, divided among six branches, and covering members dispersed in over one hundred towns and villages across Xianyou county. It cost twelve taels to add another tablet to the shrine. Similarly, the Great Descent-Line Hall of the Lin of Xianyou contained over twelve hundred ancestral tablets of sub- lineage groups spread throughout the county in the early 20th century, and these were divided into groupings of twelve shares of one hun- dred tablets each, each of which were responsible for the sacrifices in rotation.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">These higher-order lineage formations relate to increasing contra- dictions in local society. Chen Shengshao <span class="s8">陳盛韶 </span>noted in the Dao- guang period that: “In Xianyou the small surnames fear the large surnames more than they fear the officials. What are they afraid of?

The general tendency in the late Qing on the Putian plain was for an abstraction from territorial connec- tions of lineage relations, which then reconnected at a higher level in order to advance collective economic, political or social interests at the county-wide level.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In general, the low-lying, fertile, and well-watered lands of the entire Putian plain had been filled in with village settlements quite completely by the late Ming (16th century). The only area available for the found- ing of new villages was in inland foothills of the mountain ranges that ring the plain, and areas beyond the boundaries of the Qing coastal evacuations. <i>Map 9: Village Foundation Date by Dynasty </i>(see <i>Color Plates</i>) is based on survey information, and may include some errors. The villages marked as Ming villages were already settled in the Hong- zhi <span class="s8">弘治 </span>period (early 1500s), and some of them no doubt date back to the Song. Note that the late Qing villages are clustered either in the area beyond the coastal evacuation, or inland, in hilly areas around the plain which were sparsely populated. These villages were only estab- lished after the better land on the plains was completely occupied.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One can locate on the <i>Map 9: Village Foundation Date by Dynasty </i>several ritual alliances in which a single Ming village is surrounded by several mid-Qing or late Qing villages, indicating a pattern of vil- lage expansion through the development of satellite villages over time. The survey reveals that these villages were often linked in an alliance around a shared <i>gushê </i><span class="s8">古社 </span>(ancient altar of the soil) based in the Ming village.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Some of the more recent villages may have been populated by emi- grants from the Minnan region to the south of Xinghua. A number of local gazetteers and lineage genealogies confirm that there was sub- stantial immigration into the Xinghua region from the Minnan region to the south during the late Ming and early Qing, as the entire coast was disrupted by pirate invasions and the Qing coastal evacuation. Traces of Minnan immigration can be found in the distribution of deities worshipped in the Minnan area, such as Guangze zunwang and Baosheng Dadi (also known as Ciji zhenren; see Dean 1993 for further discussion of these gods and their founding temples). Note that the villages along the sea-dikes did not split off to form new villages, but they did stretch out quite far along the irrigation canals of the area to absorb rising populations of villagers and emigrants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">Although beyond the scope of this study, it would be possible to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">develop a rudimentary village morphology, based on village shapes,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 137</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">size and population, as well as proximity to irrigation canals, and the presence of market streets within some larger villages. The average population of the villages on the Putian plain is currently around 1,000 residents. The average land of each village is around 0.6 sq. km. 1000 residents appears to represent one kind of limit in terms of average population to land ratio. After that point, it is likely that satellite vil- lages were formed, or else other external resources were absorbed into the village, allowing it to break through this limit, and grow in size into a trading center. These external resources might have included success in the imperial examinations, but no doubt also included economic diversification into handicrafts, trade, smuggling, and the development of export goods such as dried <i>longyan</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Most villages on the Putian plain stretch along a canal or extend</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">between two or more canals. Lines of houses, often built side by side, stretch along these canals. Over time, additional rows of houses are added, and public space is set aside for the temples and their court- yards. On an open plain, a village may take a more circular shape. Older, larger villages develop paved market streets on central lanes. The relatively recent rise of roads and automotive transport has shifted the morphology of villages considerably, with new shops lining the road- ways, often at some distance from the older center of the village.<span class="s9">63</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Late Qing rise of feuding alliances</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The late Qing in Putian was marked by the rise of feuding banner alliances (white, black, and red (neutral)) of associated villages. <i>Map 11: of Feuding Banner Alliances of the Putian Plain in the late Qing (19th century) </i>(see <i>Color Plates</i>), shows the distribution of regional factions who fought over water rights as imperial power declined in the last half of the 19th century. Most of these divide up along regional alliance lines, but some alliances were internally divided at this time. These groupings fought primarily over water-rights, but the fighting could be provoked by the theft of a chicken, a buffalo grazing in a neighboring village field, or rude behavior to village women. Generally the scale of these fights was small, involving at most a handful of vil- lages on each side. Some of these fights took on ritualized forms, with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_100.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">63 <span class="s7">See Roberts (1987) for comparative research into English village morphology.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">138 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">regular occasions for the hurling of stones back and forth. This recalls an episode we witnessed in 2005 when two processions of gods, each claiming the same territory, collided near the Meizhou <span class="s8">湄洲 </span>ferry on the Xiuyu peninsula. In that case, stones flew until the sky was black, and the two sides pushed and shoved until a few people drew blood and the police intervened, arresting a few from each side, after which the procession turned back. The rise of these fragmented segmentary alliances in the late Qing was linked to the decline of central power under foreign and domestic (Taiping Tianguo <span class="s8">太平天國</span>) attack and the pressure of a rapidly expanding population on gradually collapsing irrigation systems. Without broader temple alliance supervision, and the threat of local government intervention, the irrigation system was wide open to local abuse.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Local legend links the banner associations to god cults, with the black banner supposedly representing Zhanggong and the white ban- ner Mazu. But the actual situation was far more complex, with the irrigation systems breaking up into battling units in a checkerboard formation (see <i>Map 11: Feuding Banner Alliances of the Putian Plain in the late Qing (19th century</i>). Only occasionally did these rival group- ings manage to coalesce into a regional alliance. This occurred mid- way through the 19th century, during the rebellion of Lin Jun <span class="s8">林俊</span>, which coincided with the Xiaodaohui <span class="s8">小刀會 </span>rebellion in Xiamen and the Taiping rebellion in central China and in Nanjing. Lin Jun was able to unite the white and black alliances of the Xinghua area to join him in ambushing Qing forces, and in attacking Putian city in 1853 (<i>Shejibian</i>, j. 2.1a–3.16b).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">A second coalition of banner associations took place in the Repub- lican period, when Huang Lian <span class="s8">黃濂 </span>(1862–1913), known as the 16th Emperor, gathered forces on Hugongshan <span class="s8">壺公山 </span>Mountain. His troops laid siege to Putian city and briefly took Xianyou city in 1912.

The latter had always been the site of strong lineages with many literati and members of the local Putian elite, while the villages of the thirty-six village alli- ance were markedly poorer and had far less access to elite status.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">An interesting cultural reaction to this increasing fragmentation and rising inter-village violence was the spread of the <i>Tanban </i>spirit medium altar associations in the Jiuliyang irrigation system around Jiangkou and in the northern reaches of the Northern Irrigated Putian plain. Ritual aspects of this tradition will be discussed below (see <i>Rit- ual Specialists: Tanban</i>). The rituals marking the completion of the training sessions of a new generation of spirit mediums drew many neighboring villages together in networks of ritual exchange, coun- terbalancing to some degree the internecine fighting of the black and white alliances (Dean and Zheng 1993).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Republican period defense of local cults</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">During the Republican period, local cults and local ritual traditions came under considerable pressure from the Republican government. The campaign to suppress popular religion was part of the New Life campaign (Duara 1995, Neodstrup 2008). The origins of this anti- clerical and anti-religious movement, linked to the modernist drive to secularization, have been traced back to figures such as Kang You- wei <span class="s8">康有為 </span>writing in the 1890’s (Goossaert 2003). As Robert Weller has remarked, the secularization of China was simultaneously the “religionization” of China, that is to say the imposition of a new defi- nition of religion as something opposed to the secular upon local ritual traditions.<span class="s9">65 </span>Several sources reveal the efforts of local temple committees and local literati to defend the cult centers of Putian. Zhang Qin <span class="s8">張琴</span>, the last Putian <i>jinshi </i>(Metropolitan Candidate), and the author of the 1945 manuscript edition of the <i>Putian xianzhi</i>, composed the <i>Kaoli zhengsu baocun shenshê shuotie (Memorial on the investigation of the rites and orthodox customs calling for the preservation of the temples of the gods) </i>in response to government anti-popular religion movements in the 1920’s:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_102.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">65 </span>Comments made at the <i>Conference on Religion and Modernity</i>, U.C.

It has established a set of regulations as a standard for the preservation of temples. These regulations are based on religion, philosophy, and the acts of merit before the people performed by the former saints, sages, and heroes. The intent of this is deep indeed. There are many licentious cults in Putian, but if one examines the essence of their intentions then few indeed are those that transgress against the [new] regulations. I have investigated the transmission, errors, transgressions, truth and falsity of these cults, basing my study on the <i>[Book] of Rites</i>, the <i>[Five] Classics</i>, the dynastic histories, and the commentaries [to the <i>Annals of the Spring and Autumn Period</i>]. Probing to the heart of the matter, I have extracted information that demonstrates their accordance with the regulations for the preservation [of cults] . . . The [common] people established <i>shê </i>altars when the <i>fengjian </i><span class="s18">封建 </span>[feudal] system collapsed. Looking at it from this perspective, it is clear the <i>shê </i>is the harbinger of the development of the people’s self-government. Because of the antiquity of the <i>shê</i>, Master Zhu [Xi] in the Song dynasty established the <i>shêxue </i><span class="s18">社學 </span>(communal academies) and <i>shêcang </i><span class="s18">社倉 </span>(communal granaries). These advanced and became self-governing collectivities (<i>zizhi tuanti </i><span class="s18">自治團體</span>). Even today the remnants of these institutions have not disappeared . . . After the Song, the worship of city gods spread throughout the empire. Some were given [official] temple plaques and some were given titles of enfeoffment, while some were by association given particular surnames and personal names, which borders on the non-canonical. However, if we recognize that the <i>shê </i>altar is the site where the gods of the soil and the grains are worshipped, then the name is correct and the terms accord, and nothing can be in doubt. Because the city god is the <i>shê </i>altar of the soil of the prefecture or district, the people’s prayers and thanksgiving are first and foremost directed towards his temple. Now the prefectural [city god] temple of Putian each year donates several thousand <i>shi </i>(stones) of rice to save the poor. These are all merciful families who voluntarily donate [food]. There is no forcible raising of contributions. Their achievements are impressive.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Zhang Qin makes several adroit moves in these citations. He links the <i>shê </i>altars to the tradition of self-government and self-sufficiency and argues that they are a school for democratic rights. He further argues that temples such as the Prefectural City God Temple at the head of the hierarchy of the temples of the Putian plains are charitable organizations dedicated to the good of all the citizens of the city. In his introduction he suggests that popular worship at the village tem- ples should be understood as a form of “freedom of belief ”. He seam- lessly blends the discourse of the classics with the language of political reform of the Republican modernizers. These arguments indicate that local ritual practices had broad support in elite circles in Putian. It</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 141</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">comes as no surprise that Zhang Qin’s parents were active members of the Three in One movement, and that he was quite familiar with the teachings of Lin Zhao’en.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Another example of a document defending local temples from gov- ernment efforts at appropriation, is the 1932 <i>Lin Xiaonu sidian Sangong Denxianshangjing guipu </i><span class="s8">林孝女祀典三宮登賢上境規譜 </span><i>(Register of the regulations of the Three [Goddess] Temple of the Upper Ascending to Sagehood Ritual Territory for the Ritual Observances dedicated to the Filial Lady Lin) </i>[Mo, i.e., Mazu].<span class="s9">66 </span>This document was composed in response to efforts on the part of the “Revolutionary” (i.e., Republican) government to ban licentious cults and destroy or take over temple buildings. In this case, the goddess Mazu was redefined as Xiaonu Lady Lin, an exemplar of filial piety, in an effort to place her in the context of the cultural nationalist traditionalism of one sector of the Republican government. The document goes on to explains that due to pressure from the Revolutionary (Republican) government, the <i>yuan- xiao </i>processions of the temple had stopped for some time, and that, as a result, considerable amounts of temple lands and rents had fallen into private hands. The situation had relaxed by 1921, and it was possi- ble to once again celebrate the <i>yuanxiao </i>procession and the feast of the <i>shê </i>association. The document was printed and distributed in order to force people to return temple property and to get everyone to adhere to a new set of regulations (discussed in more detail in Dean, 1995).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">A stone inscription from 1922 in the Jiangkou Dongyueguan <span class="s8">東 嶽 觀 </span>brings our focus back to the continuing power of the temple alliances during the Republican period:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Although Fujian borders the sea, yet the power of the spirits has truly displayed its dependability.

Mao has an interesting perspective on the political features of the <i>shê </i>temples:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">A community (<i>shê</i>) has a kind of community shrine (<i>shêtan</i>) that is dif- ferent from a shrine association. Every village has one. Even if a vil- lage has three families, there is a community shrine. Why do they want a community shrine? To ensure that their crops are not devoured by insects and that their livestock do not get sick, and to ensure the health of the people. Every community has an association. From the beginning of February to the end of October, there is a meeting each month. The meeting is usually scheduled for the second, but in some places it is on the sixteenth. On the day of the meeting, one person from each family in the community comes. Rich or poor, all have a share. A pig is killed and wine purchased for a big feast. After the feast, a meeting is held to discuss affairs like building terraces and water channels, prohibiting livestock from harming fields, and prohibiting careless use of wooded areas. The regulations are numerous, and everyone has his say. Also, there is no chairman; nor is any record [of the proceedings] desired. The discussions are chaotic, but there is a kind of natural order. So when the so-called elders or the enlightened ones voice a reasonable view, then everyone says their words have “been spoken well.” [When this happens], a decision has been made. This community of the masses is very differ- ent, even though they believe in gods, from the shrine associations of the rich peasants and landlords. The peasants run this sort of community discussions, not the bullies or the powerful gentry. Nor is it completely run by rich peasants. The informed chairman is a person whose reason- able manner causes people to trust him. Very few community shrines have public halls.

The following brief comments are intended only to sketch out the main twists and turns of this period. Despite Mao’s favorable remarks about the com- munity <i>shê </i>temples in Southeast China, the CCP was determined to attack entrenched local power structures such as lineages and mon- asteries, and local temples soon became objects of attack as well. Monastic lands and lineage estates were redistributed during the Land Reform movement of the 1950s. This process accelerated during the Cultural Revolution.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1950, local branches of the Buddhist Association were established,</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">political study groups were set up, and Buddhist organizations made donations to the government. Christian adherents were asked to sign onto the new threefold policy of self governing, self supporting, and self-transmitting churches. In 1951 large scale denunciation meetings were held against those religious figures who had received foreign funding. Many Christians contributed funds to the Korean War, and many joined the army. In 1952 work teams entered the main Buddhist monasteries and established supervisory committees and restructured workloads so the monks could be self-sufficient. Over the next six months a series of instructions on how to handle the religious sec- tor were issued. In 1953 a full scale registration of the 664 Buddhist monasteries, temples and halls, and their landholdings was carried out, and 1,672 Buddhist monks and nuns were registered. Christian groups organized an exhibition illustrating the new religious policies and the manipulation of religion by foreign imperialist forces. After an investigation of the level of counter-revolutionary imperialist activity</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">144 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">in Christian circles, the churches were allowed to carry out religious services again.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In 1954 the first struggle sessions were held against Christians accused of aiding imperialist forces. Buddhist groups again made a large donation to the state. In a major sermon, an elderly minister urged his fellow Christian to obey the laws of the state. In 1955 a com- mittee of the Pan-Religious groups of Putian was established (although without Daoist or popular cult representatives). In 1956 a series of religious sites were declared cultural relics under the protection of the county. Political study sessions were imposed on 120 Christians, and two members were declared counter-revolutionary and arrested. Churches were closed down, and many members were declared to be “rightists”. The Protestant True Jesus church was banned, and its members were dispersed, and many were arrested. During this same year, Putian Buddhist circles underwent political study sessions as well, and sent representatives to the national conference of Buddhist leaders in 1957, where one of them presided over national meetings the following year.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1958 and 1959 new regulations called for the streamlining or</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">merging of religious sites, in effect, calling for the destruction or closing of many of these sites. Authorized Catholic sites went from seventeen to two. Of the 426 Christian sites in Putian prior to 1949, thirty-six had been restored, but only twelve were permitted to remain. Buddhist sites went from 656 to only fifteen, not counting the seventy-five that were torn down. Religious leaders were assigned to political study ses- sions and underwent enforced agricultural labor. The leading policy of the time was to “extinguish religion in as short a time as possible”. This led to the reduction of temple lands, the demolishing of temples and churches, the enforced return to lay life of Buddhist monks and nuns, the holding of public lectures on atheism and the non-existence of spirits, and the razing of the tombs of Christian missionaries. In late 1959, however, twenty-four monks were allowed to travel to their branch monasteries in Southeast Asia. In 1960 Buddhist monks and nuns were once again registered and monastic farms were inspected. Some Buddhist monks were singled out for corruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1961 policy again softened somewhat and a call was issued to</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ensure that religious groups had free access to sites of religious wor- ship, as some foreign imperialists were claiming that they were being persecuted. More sites were placed under the protection of the cultural relics program, including some churches. But in 1962 attacks against</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 145</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the counter-revolutionary tendencies of Catholics were made in the Central Committee. In 1963 a report was issued on the counter-revo- lutionary activities of a (small number) of Christians in the Putian region. As a result, several Catholic leaders were assigned landlord status and denounced as rightists. With the launch of the Socialist Education Campaign, religious objects and manuscripts in temples, monasteries and private collections were gathered and destroyed. In 1965 an order was issued to tear down most temples and monasteries and to give their lands and valuables to the nearby collective farms. Monks and nuns were forcibly returned to the lay sphere. Another exhibition was held by the Patriotic Religious Association, but this time the main exhibits were bad people and evil deeds within the reli- gious sphere. Public Security investigative teams were dispatched to the Christian communities in Pinghai and Nanri townships, and they issued a report on the four purifications campaign (of ideology, eco- nomics, organization, and behavior).</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In May of 1966 the Cultural Revolution broke out. Attacks were</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">mounted against “revisionism”, and religion was declared to be extinct and relegated to the museum of history. Religious leaders were denounced as “cow demons and snake spirits”, and many were oppressed, imprisoned, and died. Bands of Red Guards raided mon- asteries and destroyed or looted religious objects. In July, the offices of the Patriotic Religious Association were ransacked and taken over by a street revolutionary committee. All the files were burned and dis- persed. The last official notice received by the Putian Bureau of Reli- gious Affairs on July 29, 1965 ordered that the Guanghuasi monastery temporarily be spared destruction. Religious figures were paraded through the streets in dunce caps, and sent to labor camps. On Lunar 6/1 of 1965 the Deputy Director of the Putian Buddhist Association, the Buddhist monk Faxin <span class="s8">法心</span>, was forced to commit suicide.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">On Sept. 11, 1965, a revolutionary work team took over the Guang- huasi and together with a middle school Red Guard unit began a Cultural Revolution campaign in which the monks were made to study the “Decisions regarding several issues in the Great Cultural Revolution”. They launched the campaign to destroy the Four Olds (old ideology, old culture, old customs, old habits). Intensive struggle sessions were held, and the monks were forced to compose 129 great character posters. Four monks were singled out as cow demons and snake spirits. All the property and bank accounts of the monastery were seized by the work team. A report was issued on the program to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">146 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">“Return the monks to the lay life”, and the monks were forced to write out “statements of resolve” renouncing their faith, and promising to be good citizens in the collective farms to which they were assigned. On Sept. 28, the Cultural Revolution work team left the Guanghuasi monastery, and moved on to the other major monasteries of Putian. In each one, they repeated the process of calling the monks together, forcing them to eat a bowl of meat soup, and then forcing them to take part in the destruction of the Buddhist images. After that, the monks were forced out of the monasteries and sent back to collective farms. Many Catholics and Protestant leaders were also singled out for attack. Churches were ransacked and little was left behind. Many churches and properties belonging to churches were impounded by communes and collective farms. In May of 1968, the Revolutionary Committee of Putian was established. It would take until March of 1980 for the new Putian Revolutionary Committee to re-establish the Religious Affairs Division.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">After the fall of the Gang of Four and the consolidation of the rule</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">of Deng Xiaoping the files of persecuted religious leaders underwent review and rectification. Three Christian leaders had their “rightist” labels removed, and their files cleared. The reputation of three Bud- dhist monks who had been forced to commit suicide, namely the monks Faxin <span class="s8">法心</span>, Ruli <span class="s8">如理</span>, and Zhenming <span class="s8">振明</span>, had their reputa- tions completely cleared (<i>zhaoxue </i><span class="s8">昭雪</span>). Sixteen individuals who had been sentenced as counter-revolutionaries had their sentences revoked, and they were allowed to return from the labor camps to their original household registrations, and their relatives who had been sent down to the countryside were allowed back as well. Wages that had been held back were issued, and a major effort was made to restore proper- ties to their original religious organizations. The Catholics got back forty-eight buildings (of their original fourteen churches and seventy- three buildings), the Protestants got back eighty-three of their original 138 churches and 189 buildings, the Buddhists got back 343 of their original 656 monasteries, halls, and temples. Reparations were made totaling nearly 600,000 yuan, and rents were restored to the respective organizations.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Over this period, the Guanghuasi Monastery had first been a center for Cultural Revolutionary work teams, then it had become a “political study center” for suspect cadres, then it was taken over by a middle school, and finally it fell into the hands of the Putian Plastics factory. The monastery was returned to the Buddhists in early 1980. The gov-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">historical overview 147</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">ernment committed 230,000 yuan to repairs, but the bulk of the resto- ration costs were supported by contributions gathered by the Buddhist monk Yuanchan <span class="s8">圓禪 </span>who had been sent to Southeast Asia in 1958, but who returned in 1979 with offers of 1.5 million yuan to rebuild the temple. Similar stories can be told about most of the other major Buddhist monasteries in Putian.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">By the end of 1980, the religious associations had been revived, and their bank accounts had been restored. Some remaining religious objects and manuscripts that had been impounded during the Cul- tural Revolution were restored to their original monasteries. A regular process was set in place for the registration of religious sites as they opened over the period from 1980 to 1990. Programs were set in place for the religious education of monks and nuns, and sixteen Buddhist ordinations were issued in 1982 in Fuzhou at the Yongquansi <span class="s8">涌泉寺 </span>on Gushan <span class="s8">鼓山 </span>mountain. A Buddhist academy was established at the Guanghuasi monastery in 1984. A series of foreign visitors including Spanish Catholic nuns from the Philippines who had worked in Putian until the early 1950s, U.S. relatives of the Methodist minister William Brewster, Japanese adherents of the Obaku Zen sect which traces its roots to the Huangboshan <span class="s8">黃檗山 </span>monastery in nearby Fuqing, all came to visit in the early 1980s. A visit by a fleet of Taiwanese fishing boats from Ilan to the partially restored Tianhou <span class="s8">天后 </span>temple on Mei- zhou Island in the Meizhou Bay revealed the great desire on the part of Taiwanese worshipers to renew pilgrimage links to the mother temple of the cult. This temple would develop over time into an enormous pilgrimage center, with rival Taiwanese temples competing to build pagodas and temples, and to erect statues and stelae all over the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Some visitors were less welcome, including Pentecostal Christian missionaries who sometimes attracted the attention of the Public Secu- rity Bureau. Some of the restoration projects were too enthusiastic and ill-considered, and ended up destroying cultural heritage buildings. Some stelae were set up on local initiative, leading to some conflicts with officials in the Religious Affairs Division.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">It appears that very low levels of ritual activity continued in some village temples from 1949 to 1965. Mostly however, such rituals went underground, and were performed in secret. The latest date of a tem- ple construction in the period from 1949 to 1980 found in the survey below was 1964, when a temple was built in an isolated village near Hanjiang. But already during the Land Reform movements and the establishment of collective farms in the 1950s, and during the Socialist</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">148 chapter three</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Education Campaign of 1963, many temples were impounded by village production brigades and used as warehouses or village administrative headquarters. This pattern continued during the Cultural Revolution, when all open ritual activity ceased, although underground activities continued (spirit medium sessions, Three in One funerals for deceased members and other minor rituals). In the 1980’s the vast majority of these temples were restored or rebuilt and often enlarged, as can be seen in the survey volume. A smaller number of new temples have also been built since 1980. By the mid 1980’s efforts were in place to begin a process of registration of these temples as authorized “sites for religious activity”. Numbered certificates to this effect hang on the walls of many temples, alongside sets of regulations covering financial accounting, hygiene, preservation of cultural relics, and other matters. In a fashion highly reminiscent of the evolution of Taiwanese offi- cial relations to local temples and ritual activities from 1950 to 1990, the Chinese state has developed a distant supervisory attitude with an increasing investment in ensuring the continuity and security of these vital social institutions at the village level. Of course, there are still complaints about extravagant waste of funds, the prevalence of spirit mediumism, the potential for charlatans and embezzlement of funds, and the potential for unfair financial burdens on villagers, but in gen- eral the attitude has been one of acceptance of a powerful social force with deep roots in local senses of morality, and delight in the playful, competitive performance of local powers that emphasize the role of the gods in everyday life.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Map 28: Contemporary Townships of the Putian Plain <span class="p">shows the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">current administrative units, the main cities, urban areas, townships and roadways as of the late 1980s.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Another map showing the effects of contemporary planning and development on the Putian plain is <i>Map 12: Urban Expansion on the Putian Plains </i>(see <i>Color Plates</i>). This map reveals the recent rapid expansion of urban space in the Putian plains. Red regions show the extent of urban space of cities and towns as of 1961. Yellow regions show the expansion of such urban space by 1989. Blue areas show the continued expansion of urban space up to 2002. Overall, urban space doubled over this period to approximately ten percent of the overall area of the Putian plain.

A thickening spider web of construction (mostly roadside con- crete apartment blocks with ground level storefronts and residential units above) is spreading across the plain, threatening to transform the entire plain into a vast urban megalopolis. In fact, this is close to the future plans of the Regional Planning Office of Putian, which envisions a series of ring roads around Putian, and a vast industrial park extending to the Xiuyu Harbor area. No doubt many more of the villages in this survey will have been razed to make way for these massive development projects in the near future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER FOUR</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: center;">CONTEMPORARY RITUAL EVENTS IN THE PUTIAN PLAINS: THE RITUAL EVENT</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Celebrations on the birthdays of the gods or at the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival of the first full moon of the year are marked with rituals at the vil- lage temple conducted by a range of ritual specialists. Processions of the gods are made up of a retinue of villagers and led by the village headsmen who rotate into the role of keeper of the incense burners of the gods. In many temples, spirit mediums are possessed by the gods. There are also performances of opera or marionettes on stages in front of the temple, performances of ritual music by traditional musi- cal ensembles, performances by visiting musical troupes such as <i>shiyin bayue </i><span class="s12">十音八樂 </span>ensembles, cart and drum female ensembles, military brass bands and marching bands, and visiting delegations from allied villages. The processions can be as small as a dozen children bearing banners and a gong, along with their mothers, escorted by a temple elder with the incense burner, another with a statue of the god, and a third older man with a loudspeaker mounted on a bicycle playing ritual music. Or a procession of a large village can stretch for over two kilometers, and include motorcycle units in police costumes, dozens of costumed troupes representing the Eight Immortals, the Journey to the West, operatic troupes, martial arts troupes, historical vignettes, ethnic minorities, women in beautiful traditional dresses, floats with children dressed as gods, several musical ensembles (traditional instru- mental  groups  as  well  as  modern  marching  bands),  disco  dancers, cross-dressed youths, traditional performance artists like stilt walkers, the man in a boat, the old geezer and his ugly wife, the giant-headed toddlers, and many more. At the center of the procession are the sedan chairs of the gods. These are immediately preceded by banners and placards and lanterns announcing the god, then by groups of ghostly demons with masked faces carrying chains and signs warning of their powers, who dance a mute demon dance in front of each temple they pass. Just in front of the sedan chairs of the gods march the <i>baban</i><span class="s12">八班</span>—the eight guards of the temple whose murals adorn most Putian temple walls. They wear a black robe with red trim and a black rattan hat, and their leader carries a long board like those used in yamen</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">152 chapter four</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">judicial interrogation sessions. A large procession may feature up to a dozen god’s sedan chairs, with costumed bearers, flags and banners, umbrellas of the gods and large fans, and incredibly elaborately carved and gilded sedan chairs—more like movable palaces—that sometimes require a dozen able bodied young sedan chair bearers. Following the gods come the temple headsmen bearing the incense burners of the gods or of the <i>shê </i>altar. They wear Qing dynasty long blue robes and Shanghai style fedoras. The temple representatives are followed by a group of elderly women with brooms sweeping the way. Sometimes they wear paper cangues around their necks (or hang them around the necks of children) to pray for forgiveness of sins and recovery of good health. More banners and flags and incense carried by crowds who have joined the procession follow. Finally a long line of small ponies with red embroidered saddles and bells on their harnesses makes up the procession. On their saddles are rectangular paper envelopes addressed to the gods with the prayers of the individual patron who paid for the pony. They are led by horsemen who make a living taking their ponies around the irrigated plain all year to take part in proces- sions. The ponies are quite used to the fireworks that are set off by every household along the way when the gods pass by. Each household prepares a table of offerings, and all the members of the household stand and bow when the gods pass, and then they set off firecrackers and burn spirit money in metal braziers before taking the offerings inside for a feast.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In many villages, the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival is also marked by an evening</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">lantern procession. Some areas place five or six lanterns on top a long stool, and then link the stools with attached lanterns to those of their neighbors. The entire linked line of lanterns can stretch on for over a kilometer. The stools and lanterns are carried on shoulder poles, and the entire line of lanterns makes a spectacular sight as it traces the boundaries of the village land or the outlines of the ritual alliance. The lanterns are generally marked with the name of the lineage, and each household is expected to provide at least one stool fitted out with lan- terns and one male son to carry it. As the linked lantern chain reaches the courtyard in front of the temple, it circles or spirals until everyone is in the courtyard. Then truckloads of fireworks, rockets and strings of firecrackers, are set off. When these have all been exploded, the procession moves on, and the next segment takes its place. Needless to say, this can go on all night.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">contemporary ritual events in the putian plains 153</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: right;">Meanwhile, inside the temple the <i>Yanshi </i><span class="s12">筵 師 </span>, Masters of Ceremo- nies, have laid out the altar, with prescribed dishes of offerings of many kinds. Some of these are elaborate works of food art, such as figures of the Eight Immortals made out of vegetables, fruit, fried toufu or wheat gluten. The <i>Yanshi </i>also set out yellow envelopes inscribed with the names of the gods invited to the ritual from the heavens and from all the nearby village temples. They also provide guidance to individual worshippers or family representatives bearing offerings to the temple. Daoist ritual masters and/or Three in One Scripture Masters and/or Buddhist monks set up a portable altar within the temple by hanging some paintings of the higher gods (or simply addressing the rite to a labeled invitation envelope on the altar). For a typical ritual on the birthday of a god, one to three Daoist masters perform rites which last three or four hours, usually beginning after the procession has returned, from 11:00pm to 3:00am. More elaborate rituals involve more ritualists, and can go on throughout the day over a two or three</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">day period.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Spirit possession often takes place as part of a ritual event, usually in the afternoon or evening. Groups of young men first burn talismans, and pass them over their heads and bodies. Then they beat drums, shake castanets, and chant the invocations of the gods with rhythmic steps. One of them will prepare to don the clothing of the gods. Elder altar associates will assist him by tightly tying a cloth around his head, and then placing the god’s headdress on him. He will also be dressed in the robes and shoes of the god. When he is fully clothed, he listens to the chanting, beginning to sway back and forth. Suddenly, he slaps the altar table, and picks up the sword of the god. He begins to pace with long strides rapidly around the temple. His handlers guide him out the temple. Once possessed, he may begin a dance, or speak in the voice of the gods. In other regions, the medium often goes bare- chested, or wears a child’s apron over his chest to indicate that he is a child of the gods. In some villages, there are regularly scheduled spirit possession sessions, either in the form of spirit writing (usually one of the wielders of the forked branch used to write characters in the sand on top of an altar is possessed), or through direct interaction with a possessed medium. The village temples also provide a regular site for interaction with the gods on a daily basis. Individual worshippers are free to visit at any time, and to pose questions to the gods.

These last for over a month, with the larger villages celebrating closer to <i>Yuanxiao </i>(the Lantern Festival) on the full moon of the first lunar month, and smaller villages scheduling their celebrations either beforehand or afterwards, in order to be able to book opera troupes and ritual specialists, and invite guests. The birthdays of individual gods are also celebrated in different temples throughout the year. These festivities can also go one for several days, or over a month, depending on the scope of the celebration. Here again, on the birthday of very popular deities such as Tiangong yuanshuai, the god of theater on lunar 4/8 and in the eighth month, or Tianshang Shengmu (Mazu) on lunar 3/23, or Xuantian shangdi on lunar 3/3, celebrations can be held for several different days around the main feast day of the god. There are also major processions that take place on longer temporal cycles, once every three or five or twelve or sixty years, in which gods are carried to many participating village temples from central temples of the higher order ritual alliances. In the Survey volume, we record 1,642 ritual events in the first lunar month, when every village holds at least one day of celebrations. The later months report lower num- bers of birthday celebrations, with 444 in the second month, 422 in the third month, 376 in the fourth month, 301 in the fifth month, 236 in the sixth month, 422 in the seventh month, 412 in the eighth month, 272 in the ninth month, 306 in the tenth month, 96 in the 11th month, and only 30 celebrations recorded in the 12th lunar month. In total, the number of regularly scheduled annual ritual events is close to 4,200, or over 360 per month. This number does not include occa- sional rites that can be sponsored by individuals or communities at any time. Nor do these figures include private worship that occurs on a daily basis at the over 2,500 temples of the 724 villages of the Putian plains. Given this frequency of ritual activity, we conclude that ritual is an intensification of everyday life, rather than something held apart as separate and sacred. There is a continuum of increasing intensification from daily domestic ritual, to individual offerings of incense and spirit money in the village temples, to participation in the village celebra- tions on the birthdays of the gods and at Chinese New Year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER FIVE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">RITUAL SPECIALISTS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">There are many ritual specialists operating in the irrigated Putian plains. This chapter introduces Daoist ritual masters, various kinds of spirit mediums, Three in One Scripture masters, Buddhist monks, Confucian masters of ceremony known in the Putian area as <i>Yanshi</i><span class="s12">筵師 </span>(masters of the banquet), lay Buddhist ritualists of many initia- tory movements, and a host of other ritual specialists involved in dif- ferent aspects of ritual activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Daoist ritual specialists</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Daoist ritual masters play the predominant role in conducting rituals in village temples during the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival and for the birthdays of the gods, as can be seen on virtually every page of the Survey. In order for so many rituals to be performed in so small an area (464 sq. km), a substantial number of Daoist ritual specialists have to be trained and organized into troupes under the direction of Daoist Masters of High Merit (<i>Daoshi </i><span class="s12">道士</span>, <i>Gaogong </i><span class="s12">高功</span>). Large scale rites require the involvement of up to nine Daoist masters. Average size rites call for three to five ritual specialists, while a single Daoist master can per- form a shorter rite on the birthday of a god or at a <i>Yuanxiao </i>ritual for a smaller village temple. Thus each region of the Putian plain must support a number of Daoist ritual specialists. Although exact figures would require another focused survey, findings from the Jiuliyang Irri- gation system of Jiangkou township can serve as an illustration of the range of Daoist ritual specialist troupes.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In that area, made up of some seventy villages, five troupes of Dao- ist ritual specialists divide the ritual market between themselves. These are Wu Jiutao <span class="s12">吳九濤 </span>of Shiting, (Qingjingtan <span class="s12">清靜壇</span>), Lu Tianlin of Jiangkou (Xingyingjing <span class="s12">顯應境</span>), Fang Peitian of Jiangkou (Qimiao- jing <span class="s12">奇妙境</span>), Huang Falin of Qianmian (Xuanmiaojing <span class="s12">玄妙境</span>), and Huang Wenrui of Guangu (Shenyingjing <span class="s12">神應境</span>). The largest and most established of the groups is led by Daoist Master Wu Jiutao, whose two sons are also accomplished Daoist masters. Several grandsons and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">156 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">outside disciples complement his ritual troupe. Wu Jiutao lives in Shit- ing village. His two story home contains an altar to Lord Lao, and a chest filled with manuscripts of Daoist scriptures and liturgies. These include manuscripts passed down by what he claims were five genera- tions of ancestors who worked as Daoist ritual masters. His collection also includes a Qing dynasty manuscript copy of the <i>Huangtingjing</i><span class="s12">黃庭經 </span>(<i>Scripture of the Yellow Chamber</i>), a book dating back to the Six Dynasties with depictions of the gods of the body used in Daoist meditation (Schipper 1975; Schipper and Verellen 2004:96–97, 184–5). Master Wu jokes that he uses the book for bed-time reading. Several manuscripts in his collection date to the Qing Daoguang (1821–50) era. A number of manuscripts in his father’s hand survive, including one long list of formularies of prayers, memorials, and reports, includ- ing some for workers in the sea-salt fields that used to be a feature of the area. Master Wu can perform the entire repertoire of Putian Dao- ist rites, including some rites specific to the Jiangkou region (see the discussion of <i>Tanban </i>spirit medium altar associations below). Mas- ter Wu is now in his late 80’s, but continues to conduct long and physically demanding rites. Both of his sons are accomplished Daoist ritual masters as well. His prominence in the Jiangkou area led to an invitation in 1985 to conduct rituals at the decennial <i>Pudu </i><span class="s12">普度 </span>rites of universal salvation held at the Jiulidong <span class="s12">九鯉洞 </span>branch temple in Singapore. His services are always in demand, and he maintains a busy schedule. Every ritual requires a prior, extensive period of preparation of posted proclamations, memorials, reports, passports, talismans, and prayers, as well as paper figurines of horses with mounted messen- gers and substitute bodies. The ground-floor of Master Wu’s home is packed with such figures, and is a veritable ritual production center.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Another distinguished Daoist family in the area is lead by a Master Huang in Qianmian village. His manuscript version of the <i>Daodejing </i>copies an earlier copyist’s date of the Kangxi period. A third well- known troupe is led by another Master Lu, in Jiangkou town. Two other less prominent Daoist families/troupes also regularly perform rites in the Jiangkou area. All five of these families are represented in the <i>Saigonghui </i>(<i>Shigonghui</i>) <span class="s12">師公會 </span>(Assembly of Daoist Masters) rites held in the main temple of the Jiangkou region, the Dongyue- guan, during the <i>Yuanxiao </i>rites of the New Year. These Daoist ritual specialists provide ritual services for some sixty or seventy villages in the Jiuliyang irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 157</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">A manuscript photographed in the home of a Daoist priest near Fengting <span class="s12">楓亭 </span>in Xianyou county shows that Daoist ritual specialists kept calendars listing the names of temples with which they had an annual relationship. This particular manuscript lists the names and deities of over sixty temples for whom the Daoist ritual master con- ducted rites over the course of a single year. Many Daoist households must have similar long-standing arrangements with a network of nearby temples. In addition, of course, they respond to requests for individual and family rituals, from weddings to <i>shoujin</i>g <span class="s12">收驚 </span>minor rites of gathering the spirits that frighten small children, to <i>guoguan</i><span class="s12">過關 </span>rites of prophylactic passage through astronomically determined adversities, to rites to deliver children from smallpox (<i>Lujiao </i><span class="s12">魯醮</span>), to rites of thanksgiving for good fortune and the repayment of vows to the gods (<i>Yuanxi </i><span class="s12">願戲</span>), to burials and funerals and <i>gongde </i><span class="s12">功德 </span>requiem services for the dead.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">For each ritual, in addition to bringing along their own ritual spe- cialists (the chief cantor and the acolytes who lead the dance and light the incense), Daoist Masters must also assemble a group of musicians for ritual performances. These musicians can work for opera troupes, marionettists, ritual music ensembles of various kinds, and Dao- ist, Buddhist or Three in One ritual masters. The average ensemble includes a drummer (usually a Daoist ritual master), one to two <i>suona </i><span class="s12">嗩 吶 </span>(double reed shawm) players, and one or two transverse bamboo flute players. Often a cymbalist/gong player is added, and on some occasions stringed instruments join in.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">The Buddhist monks in the Putian area conduct a wide range of indi- vidual and public rituals as well. These include </span>Fahui <span class="s12">法會 </span><span class="p">(Dharma gatherings and sutra recitations) in the monasteries, as well as funer- als, consecrations of temples and ancestral halls, and especially </span>Pudu <span class="p">rites of Universal Salvation of the Hungry Ghosts. The latter are rites directed to the ghosts of those outside the sphere of ancestral worship who are said to be released from the Underworld during this month. The rites stand in counterpoint to the New Years Lantern Festival rites of the First lunar full moon when the gods of the village temples are celebrated. The </span>Lanpen <span class="s12">蘭盆 </span>Pudu <span class="p">rites are usually held on the 15th of the 7th Lunar month (the Zhongyuan Middle Prime date). However, these rites are usually performed in Putian on the Lower Prime (the 15th day (full moon) of the tenth lunar month, due to a local custom related to a legend about the pirate invasions of the late Ming. These</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">158 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">rites can be performed by Buddhist monks, but Daoist ritual specialists have developed their own versions of these rites, as have the Scripture Masters of the Three in One religious movement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Three in One Scripture  Masters</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Three in One religious movement, mentioned in the historical introduction above, has spread to over 1000 temples in the Putian and Xianyou area. This tradition began by considering Confucian moral- ity as the fundamental form of self-cultivation, but added to it Daoist inner alchemy and Buddhist meditation. Lin Zhao’en <span class="s12">林兆恩 </span>(1527– 1598), also known as Lin Longjiang <span class="s12">林龍江</span>, the founder of the move- ment, renounced the route of the official examinations and a career in the court or field bureaucracy. Instead he developed the Nine Stages of the Heart Method, a form of meditation still taught to this day in hundreds of temples in the Xinghua region. Shortly after his death, Lin was deified by his followers as the god Xiawuni <span class="s12">夏午尼</span>. Temples began to be dedicated to him, eighteen within his own lifetime, and twenty-six more by 1663. Several hundred Three in One temples were built over the Qing dynasty, and the number of temples appears to have doubled in Republican times. There are currently over 1000 Three in One temples in Putian and Xianyou counties. Lin’s teachings were taken up by several disciples. Amongst these disciples, Lin Zhenming placed particular emphasis on ritual practice, incorporating through close imitation several Buddhist and Daoist rites. Various schisms formed in the movement, with some branches emphasizing study and exposition of the Confucian classics (the Wuben <span class="s12">悟本 </span>school, active in the Hanjiang to Jiangkou area), while others such as the Mingxia <span class="s12">明夏 </span>branch emphasized meditation, visualization and ritual performance. Over time, a large body of scriptures was composed about local gods, in a process similar to the Daoist writing up of local cultic materials into a universal framework (Ding (Dean) and Zheng, 1993). An entire ritual repertoire modeled on that of local Buddhist monks and Daoist ritual masters was developed.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Currently, there are perhaps thirty or forty troupes, made up of five to nine Three in One Scripture Masters each, active in the irrigated Putian plain. Like Daoist ritual masters, they are invited to perform rites at local temples, especially the rites of the <i>Xiayuan Lanpen pudu</i><span class="s12">下元蘭盆普度 </span>(Rites of Universal Salvation of the Lower Prime). It is considered an aspect of their general morality that they tend to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 159</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">charge less for their ritual services than the Daoist and Buddhist ritual specialists. In many cases in the survey materials below, where villag- ers reported that Daoist masters were invited to conduct rites on the birthday of a god or during the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festivities, it is quite pos- sible that a Three in One Scripture master might have been invited (or might be invited in the future) in place of a Daoist master. Of course, the network of Three in One temples (roughly one for every two vil- lages) provides a large set of venues for ritual activity. Daily offer- ings of tea and scripture recitation take place in these temples. More elaborate rituals are arranged on the birthday and ascension day of Lin Zhao’en (1/16 and 7/16), and on the days of commemoration of the four principal disciples and other patrons of local Three in One tem- ples. Many other gods are worshipped in some Three in One temples, especially those of the Mingxia branch. For example, the legend goes that Lin Zhenming <span class="s12">林貞明 </span>defeated Tiangong yuanshuai <span class="s12">田公元帥 </span>(the god of theater) in a battle of magical powers (<i>doufa </i><span class="s12">鬥法</span>), and that as a result Tian was forced to serve as the Instructor of Music and Dance for the Three in One ritualists. Generally speaking, participa- tion in a Three in One temple community is voluntary. After initiation into the Heart Method, adherents can practice meditation together, or involve themselves in ritual activities. The Three in One provides an additional, supplemental level of ritual action, rather than replacing or denying any other aspect of village ritual life. Involvement in these ritual actions also brings self-selected villagers into a broader sphere of ritual activity through the many invitations to assist in other Three in One rituals within specific subsections of the Putian irrigated plain. Through the Three in One, these villagers can publicly perform their morality, and find an avenue for the collective and mutually validating pursuit of moral self-cultivation. In a few villages, the Three in One temple has become the main village temple, and the entire commu- nity is mobilized for its ritual events, and Lin Longjiang is carried in a sedan chair in a procession around the village boundaries. By virtue of its great success in the Xinghua area, the Three in One has greatly enriched local cultural life by adding another layer of ritual complexity to an already extraordinarily vibrant local scene.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spirit mediums, part 1</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In the late Qing, the irrigation systems began to break down and a pat- tern of feuding village banner alliances divided the Putian plain into a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">160 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">checkerboard of local conflicts. Interestingly, at this very point a new form of collective spirit medium training began in the northern part of the irrigated plain, helping to create new networks and connections between local villages</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The <i>Tanban </i><span class="s12">壇班 </span>Altar Associations of the northern irrigated plain are a fascinating example of a particular ritual sub-culture that has emerged within a specific, limited area of the Xinghua region. Many temples in the Nanan Weir Jiuliyang irrigated plain, and some tem- ples in the adjacent northern reaches of the northern irrigated plain, have a tradition of collective training of spirit mediums, followed by a graduation ceremony complete with the bestowal of Daoist certifi- cates of immortality. In some seventy to one hundred villages in this region, young boys from the ages of five to fifteen are gathered into a temple for three periods of seven to nine days of intensive training in collective dance, recitation of spells and invocations of the gods, and spirit possession. Only those few children who can dream of the gods are given additional guidance in trance techniques. These <i>shentong</i><span class="s12">神童 </span>(spirit mediums) will then be dressed as the gods of the temple who have possessed them, and they will lead the <i>futon</i>g <span class="s12">扶童 </span>(assistant lads) in collective dances inside and outside the temple. These dances in the temple courtyards are referred to locally as <span class="s12">行儺 </span>(<i>xingnuo</i>) per- forming the <i>Nuo </i>exorcism. This is a reference to the ancient custom of exorcizing the evil spirits at New Years described in classical texts as having been conducted by a <i>fangxiangshi </i><span class="s12">方相氏 </span>(exorcist) in a gold mask with four faces and a black bearskin cape, wielding a lance and leading a troupe of torch-bearing soldiers (Bodde 1975). The term <i>xingnuo </i>is used in proclamations issued by the gods to the older spirit mediums in the temple during the training sessions, generally through spirit writing sessions (of these, see below). The three training sessions are referred to as <i>guanjie </i><span class="s12">關戒 </span>(being enclosed in the temple to accept the prohibitions).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">At the conclusion of the <i>guanjie </i>rites, the doors of the temple are cast open, flames shoot out, and then the newly possessed mediums emerge, following a leader of the dance carrying a flag. The pace of the dance intensifies, and the patterns formed by the medium and the altar assistants follow patterns found in <i>Huace </i><span class="s12">花 册 </span>(flower pattern books) kept by Masters of the Altar Association. These masters also keep documents listing the spells of invocation and the melodies of the chants, along with collections of couplets for decorating the inner</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 161</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">and outer altars, and sets of documents issued by the gods during the <i>guanjie </i>training sessions. After completing several rounds of training, initiates undergo a <i>yuxiu </i><span class="s12">預修 </span>(preparatory cultivation [for immortal- ity]) rite and receive additional certificates, making them into <i>gong- cao </i><span class="s12">功曹 </span>(divine officials). These documents are kept in small wooden boxes stored in the temples alongside an altar dedicated to the spirit mediums of the temple throughout the ages (<i>Lidai gutan </i><span class="s12">歷代古壇</span>). The earliest dated stelae of this kind we have located are from the late Qing and early Republican period, but we have also found Daoist lit- urgies for the granting of certificates to the Altar Associates dating to the Daoguang period (1821–1850).<span class="s9">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Each <i>guanjie </i>rite is marked by elaborate ceremonies and proces- sions that draw in a large number of delegations from surrounding villages  who  bring  gifts  and  offer  support,  and  who  are  feasted  in return. During one <i>guanjie </i>ritual we attended in Liangcuo <span class="s12">梁厝 </span>vil- lage in 1993, a small shed was built to contain strips of yellow paper bearing congratulatory messages from some forty-five villages in the vicinity. Thus the <i>guanjie </i>rites formed the event-nodes of yet another ritual network in the area (see Dean and Zheng 1993 for a description of this ritual).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The <i>guanjie </i>spirit medium training rites were revived in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, just at the point when Overseas Chinese from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia were first allowed to return to China. As will be explained below, many of these émigrés from the Jiangkou region had strong connections with networks of local tem- ples across Southeast Asia built up by spirit medium societies. These return visitors put great emphasis on rebuilding temples and sponsor- ing <i>guanjie </i>spirit medium training sessions. As an entire generation had been skipped as a result of the Chinese revolution and especially the Cultural Revolution, there were many families eager to include their male children in the training sessions. However, due to the hyper-development of the area, many young men would leave their villages when they reached the age of eighteen or twenty. They moved first to construction sites and factories in Putian, Fuzhou and Xia- men, and then later all around China in the footsteps of the far-flung Putian business networks. Later they moved to Macao and to Southeast</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_106.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">1 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 325, p. 361, No. 329, p. 364.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">162 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Asia, often basing themselves initially in the temples of the spirit medium societies. In more recent years, they have spread to Europe (especially Milan) and Argentina. Thus it became necessary to hold repeated spirit-medium trainings every five years or so to replenish the numbers of <i>tanban </i>altar associates. One result of this acceleration of a cycle of training that appears to have been once in a generation in late Qing times has been the spreading of a profound degree of familiar- ity with the local gods, their legends, and their miracles amongst the population of the northern irrigated plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Once trained as a <i>shentong </i>(spirit medium) or a <i>futong </i>(assistant to the medium), the member of the <i>Tanban </i>takes part in annual rites at <i>Yuanxiao </i>which include exorcistic dances outside the temple (<i>xing- nuo </i><span class="s12">行 儺 </span>) and sealing the roadways leading into the villages against demonic influences ( <i>fenglu </i><span class="s12">封 路 </span>). The spirit mediums are often capa- ble of transmitting communications from the god through spirit writ- ing (usually two men, one of whom at least must be possessed, grasp the two ends of a forked branch and use the other end to write rapid, swirling characters on an altar (sometimes in sand). These movements are interpreted by a third officiant. Such séances can be regular, or spe- cially requested for emergencies. Topics covered include remedies for disease, advice on life changing decisions, or even investment advice (Jordan and Overmyer 1986). In addition, the members of the <i>Tanban </i>have achieved a kind of preliminary immortality, and thus seem to be free of the danger of death pollution. They are called upon in large funerals and requiem services to assist in tearing down and burning the paper underworlds and other ritual paraphernalia of these rites.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The history of the rise of the <i>Tanban </i>ritual tradition is obscure, as collective spirit medium training may have been part of the local cul- ture for many centuries. The particular form this tradition has taken in the northern reaches of the Putian plain can be seen as a response to the breakdown of social controls at the end of the Qing over the irrigation systems and other aspects of everyday life. As mentioned in the historical introduction above, at that time the villages of the Putian plain divided up into a checkerboard of feuding alliances. Most of these banner alliances were based on the ritual alliances, but there are a significant number of instances in which ritual alliances split into competing and feuding banner alliances. It is likely that the rise of the <i>Tanban </i>ritual tradition was a response to the breakdown of higher order alliances. The new networks of mutually supporting villages that developed around these multiple sites of spirit medium training may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 163</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">have provided a counter-measure to the increasingly centripetal forces tearing the village alliances apart.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One particular group of spirit mediums have left a more complete record. These are the founders of the Jiulidong <span class="s12">九鯉洞 </span>(Nine Carp Cavern temple) of Shiting <span class="s12">石庭</span>, which has since spread to Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. The founders of this spirit medium led net- work of temples received a vision of four hitherto unknown gods: the Immortals Lu Shiyuan <span class="s12">士元盧仙長</span>, Wang Chengguang <span class="s12">成光王仙師</span>, Chen Shande <span class="s12">善德陳仙師</span>, and XieYuanhui <span class="s12">元暉謝仙師</span>. Other groups of spirit mediums in the area worship different deities under the name of the Jinlun <span class="s12">金輪 </span>(Golden Wheel) and Qiongyaopai <span class="s12">瓊瑤派 </span>(Fine Jade). A group calling themselves devotees of the Lushan altar are dedicated to Zhaoling sandian zhenjun <span class="s12">昭靈三殿真君</span>, Jiutian Tiangong yuanshuai <span class="s12">九天田公元帥</span>, Qitian dasheng <span class="s12">齊天大聖</span>, Fatian Zhang shengjun <span class="s12">法天張聖君</span>, and Tongtian Zhang shenghou <span class="s12">通天章聖侯</span>, while the Jinlun spirit medium altar is dedicated to Xuantian shangdi <span class="s12">玄天上帝</span>, Wen <span class="s12">溫公元帥</span>, Kang <span class="s12">康公元帥</span>, (Wuxian) Ma <span class="s12">五顯馬元帥</span>, and (Xuantan) Zhao yuanshuai <span class="s12">玄壇趙元帥</span>.

In the northern irrigated plain, but south of the area which practices <i>tanban </i>collective spirit medium training, there is a ritual tradition known as <i>caihua </i><span class="s12">採 花 </span>(lit. plucking flowers), which actually refers to a test of endurance in which mediums stand bare-chested in the flames of a large Roman candle. The mediums of these village temples are pri- marily self-selected (or as many claim, they are chosen by the gods, sometimes against their wills) and trained by older mediums and temple keepers. Groups of young men chant the invocations of the gods until one of their number becomes possessed. This fellow is then dressed in the god’s clothing. After talismans have been burned over him, he slaps his hand on his altar (usually the portable yamen of the inspecting god), and leaps to his feet. He will then proceed to dance with an exaggerated gait inside or outside the temple. Other medi- ums may join in this dance. On set occasions, mediums from several</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">164 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">surrounding village temples are invited to <i>caihua </i>ceremonies. The local mediums greet the visiting mediums with a series of exaggerated bows and a swooping dance. The visiting mediums first visit the temple and honor the local gods, and then go onto a raised platform outside the temple. There they bear their chests, and stand in the shooting flames of a large Roman candle. After enduring as many of these showers of sparks as possible, they descend from the platform, and return to their home village with their entourage. Such events can go on all night, and involve thirty or forty villages in yet another ritual network. In some areas, the mediums also strike themselves with maces made of sharp nails or pierce their cheeks or hands with skewers. These mediums are carried on sedan chairs through the streets of the village, at times temporarily blocking major roads for a short time. In other areas, the mediums are carried in procession through the village streets to each temple, where they perform obeisances and wield their weapons. In the evening, these mediums are led over or around bonfires and heaps of glowing coals, followed by teams of young men running with minia- ture sedan chairs made of palm leaves with the god’s names inscribed on the chairs.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The spirit mediums of the southern irrigated plain do not appear</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">to play so prominent a role as those of the northern irrigated plain, including especially the <i>tanban </i>of the Jiuliyang plain around Jiangkou. However, their presence is essential to ritual events in the southern plain as well. Mediums escort the processions of the gods, or are car- ried in sedan chairs within the procession. Mediums go into trance, write talismans, walk over burning coals, and engage in spirit writing and healing rites. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to speculate that the relative predominance of literati households and prominent lineages in the southern irrigated plain led to a situation in which the spirit mediums were less spectacularized and central to communal ritual than in the northern plain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Spirit mediums, part 3</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Other spirit mediums active in the Putian plains specialize in contact- ing the dead, and thus fall somewhat outside the parameters of this study. Many of these are women who have their own small, private household altars or small temples, and so may have escaped notice in the survey below.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 165</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other ritual specialists</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Ritual specialists proliferate in the Putian plains, as elsewhere through- out Chinese society. Marionettists are also ritual specialists. The leader of an opera troupe, or a senior member of the troupe, performs rituals for the consecration of the stage prior to performances. Some plays, such as the Mulian <span class="s12">目連 </span>plays, incorporate ritual sequences directly into the drama. <i>Yanshi </i>(Masters of the Banquet) prepare the altars and organize the offerings provided during the rituals. Their role resembles that of the <i>Lishen</i>g <span class="s12">禮生 </span>(Masters of Confucian rites) who play a cen- tral role in the ritual events of the Minnan and Minxi regions (Liu 2006). Members of the processions of the gods include ritual perform- ers wearing masks who perform “demonic dances” while rattling their chains and brandishing their official edicts from the underworld.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">One could argue that each family altar represents the ritual center of attraction for the family, which can be seen as a ritual unit. A graduate student once attended a rite of worship of ancestors within a <i>gucuo</i><span class="s12">古厝 </span>(old ancestral house—not a full-fledged ancestral hall). She noticed that there were no men present, only older and middle aged women laying out offerings on tables in the main hall of the home and lighting sticks of incense. When she asked why there were no men present, people replied that of course they were there. The implica- tion seemed to be that the women were representing their male affinal lines, so that the patriline was clearly present in the hall (Anderson, 2002).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">If one views each household in a village as a ritual actor/element in a collective rite of the village temple which mobilizes the entire com- munity, then the ritual basis of familial life in Chinese society can be seen as multifaceted and multilayered. As we will see below, participa- tion in certain communal rites is mediated through ritual membership in lineage as well as settlement. Ritual specialists assist in these various mediations. Of course, the <i>paterfamilias </i>(or often his surrogate, the devout matron of the family) is also a kind of ritual specialist. Every- thing from property rights to inheritance to variegated social roles are mediated through ritual roles.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Some villages (a distinct minority) in the Putian plains have main- tained elaborate lineage hall ancestral rites, in which <i>Lisheng </i>(masters of ceremony) from within the lineage play a central role in calling out the sequence of ritual actions (bowing, offerings, invocations, invita- tions, further bowing and more offerings). They also organize sacrifices</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">166 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">at the graves of lineage ancestors (see Dean 1993, for a description of the rituals performed at the grave of the parents of a local god).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Buddhist monks</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Buddhist ritual specialists play an important role in some local village ritual events as well. Since the Cultural Revolution, when the major Buddhist monasteries were closed and most monks and nuns were forced into secular life, Buddhism has revived in Putian. The Guang- huasi was in ruins during the Cultural Revolution, but it has been rebuilt, and now contains an active Buddhist academy which trains and ordains Buddhist monks. This center is second only to Nanputo <span class="s12">南 普 陀 </span>Temple in Xiamen and Gushansi <span class="s12">鼓 山 寺 </span>in Fuzhou in the training and ordaining of Buddhist monks in Fujian. A nunnery in Putian is dedicated to the training of Buddhist nuns. Many of the ordained monks and nuns from these academies are assigned to local small scale monasteries and nunneries in the Putian area.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In (official) theory, Buddhist rites should only be performed within</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">monastic walls, and several larger monasteries have facilities for in- house requiem services. These monasteries also conduct periodic <i>Fahui</i><span class="s12">法會 </span>(Dharma Assemblies) which are well attended and which are sponsored through voluntary contributions. Some monasteries offer outreach programs for lay initiates as well. However, a number of the mid-level monasteries maintain troupes of ritual specialist monks who can be invited to perform rites in the villages. Sometimes a troupe is assembled from several smaller monasteries. These troupes perform funerals, requiems, <i>Lanpen pudu </i><span class="s12">蘭盆普度 </span>(rites of universal salva- tion for the hungry ghosts), consecrations of temples and ancestral halls, blessings, exorcisms, and a wide range of minor rites for families or individuals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Lay Buddhist groups and so-called “secret religions”</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Several lay Buddhist groups and so called “secret religions” can also be found in the Putian plains. These include the Longhuajiao <span class="s12">龍華教</span>, the Jintangjiao <span class="s12">金堂教 </span>(also written as the Jintongjiao <span class="s12">金童教 </span>or the Jing- tangjiao <span class="s12">經堂教</span>, but more commonly referred to as the Guanmenjiao<span class="s12">關門教</span>), and the Xiantianjiao <span class="s12">先天教</span>. Like the Three in One religious movement discussed above, these groups represent additional levels of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 167</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">voluntary engagement in ritual and self-cultivation available to villag- ers. They do not exclude participation in everyday village ritual, but rise out of that background. Moreover, like the Three in One, they are not in fact “secret religions” at all, but rather openly welcome new initiates to their temples, where stelae openly outline their histories and ritual practices.<span class="s9">2 </span>The front hall of their temples are dedicated to common Buddhist deities such as Guanyin <span class="s12">觀 音 </span>, the Bodhisattva of Mercy. The inner chambers are restricted to initiates, and are dedicated to a range of gods, including the founders of their religious movements and chief disciples of their respective founders. They welcome new initiates, and provide a carefully guided series of meditational levels for their initi- ates. They also maintain an internal hierarchy, with various ranks and liturgical functions. Thus they also have their own ritual specialists who conduct the rituals they have developed. The fact that their wor- ship and guided forms of self-cultivation are restricted to initiates has led to the label of “secret religions”, and to their frequently being made the object of state suspicion and often persecution during the late Qing and in the post 1949 period (see Overmyer 1976, 1999; Ma and Han 1992; Seiwert 2003).</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The Longhuajiao <span class="s12">龍華教 </span>Buddhist religious movement is a lay Bud-</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">dhist group that evolved out of the larger movement referred to as the Wuweijiao <span class="s12">無為教</span>, begun by Luo Qing <span class="s12">羅清 </span>(1442–1527). Luo Qing was the author of collection of scriptures and <i>baojuan </i><span class="s12">寶卷 </span>(precious scrolls) that outlined his theory of <i>zhenkong </i><span class="s12">真空 </span>(true emptiness) known as the <i>Wubuliuce </i><span class="s12">五部六册 </span>(<i>Five scriptures in six volumes</i>). The main deities introduced in his writings are Zhenkong Laozu <span class="s12">真空老祖 </span>and Wusheng Laomu <span class="s12">無生老母</span>. A mantra that sums up the teachings of Patriarch Luo goes “<i>zhenkong guxiang, wusheng fumu </i><span class="s12">真空故鄉</span>, <span class="s12">無生父母 </span>(True emptiness is my home (where I find) the unborn vener- able father and mother)”. Luo Qing’s teachings attracted many offi- cials at the court, especially palace eunuchs. His teachings also spread along the Grand Canal amongst groups of boatmen. The rapid spread of the movement led to jealous attacks from mainstream Buddhist groups and eventually to court suspicion and prohibitions, leading to his imprisonment and ultimately to the burning of the <i>Wubuliuce </i>in 1616. Meanwhile, Luo Qing’s family members established the Wuwei- jiao <span class="s12">無為教</span>. These teachings were carried on by the second and third</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_107.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">2 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995, No. 304, p. 342.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">168 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">patriarchs of the Wuweijiao, Yin Jinan <span class="s12">殷繼南 </span>(Puneng <span class="s12">普能</span>) and Yao Wenyu <span class="s12">姚文余 </span>(Pushan <span class="s12">普善</span>) in Shandong. Yao declared himself to be the Patriarch Wuji shengzu <span class="s12">無濟聖祖 </span>and changed the name of his teachings to the Longhuajiao <span class="s12">龍華教</span>. The principal scripture of the movement is the <i>Sanzu xingjiao yinyou baojuan </i><span class="s12">三祖行腳因由寶卷</span>.

Like the Three in One movement, the Longhuajiao practices initiation into a graduated series of levels of meditation leading to enlightenment. They have developed their own rituals, scriptures, liturgies, hierarchical ranks in an organization, and stages of meditation.<span class="s9">3 </span>Initiation involves accepting the Three Refuges (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha), and the Five Prohibitions (against killing, stealing, licentiousness, wild speech, and eating sharp foods and drinking alcohol).

In addition to the temples described above, they list the following as the most important of these temples: The Hanjiang Yangfang <span class="s12">涵江揚芳 </span>(Zilintang <span class="s12">紫林堂</span>), the Xiandetang <span class="s12">賢德堂 </span>in Hanjiang, the Xin- xiangtang <span class="s12">信香堂 </span>and Yixintang <span class="s12">義信堂 </span>in Putian, and the Rendetang<span class="s12">仁德堂 </span>in Tianwei <span class="s12">田尾 </span>village. As noted above, many of the Long- huajiao temples were established in the peninsula extending beyond the irrigated Putian plain towards the sea beyond Hushi. This area was affected by the coastal evacuation of the early Qing. Lineage networks and irrigation networks were weakened in these regions. Tighter and more focused networks based on membership through initiation into one of many such religious movements (Three in One, Longhua, Guan- men, Xiantian and other groups) flourished in these circumstances.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Jintangjiao <span class="s12">金堂教 </span>or Guanmenjiao <span class="s12">關門教 </span>was no exception to this rule, as it also flourished in the <i>jiewai </i>(beyond the borders) regions of Putian. According to local adherents, their tradition can be traced back to one Wang Zuotang <span class="s12">王左塘 </span>(1564–1629), religious name Guangming <span class="s12">法名光明</span>, style name Taixu <span class="s12">號太虚</span>, who was a dis- ciple of Longhuajiao Master Sun zushi <span class="s12">孫祖師</span>. Master Sun sent Wang to spread the teachings in the Suzhou and Jinhua regions of Zhejiang, where Wang changed the name of the teachings to the Jingtangjiao <span class="s12">金堂教</span>. He was arrested in 1613 and released from jail in 1619, when he set out again for the south to spread the teachings once again.<span class="s9">7 </span>According to writings of the Jintangjiao such as the <i>Sanjiao genyuan</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_110.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">7 </span>Wang Zuotang is sometimes confused in the writings of the Jintangjiao with Wang Daosen <span class="s16">王道森 </span>(1542–1619), the founder of the Wenxiangjiao <span class="s16">聞香教</span>, also called the Dachengjiao <span class="s16">大乘教</span>.

Cai was a merchant transmitting goods to Wenzhou, and had joined the Long- huajiao of Yao Wenyu <span class="s12">姚文余</span>. He converted to the Jintangjiao after encountering Wang Zuotang <span class="s12">王左塘 </span>in Jinhua. He built the first Jintangjiao temple in Shanyu <span class="s12">上俞 </span>village in Hanjiang. His first ten disciples were chosen from within his own lineage. His tomb is in Wutang Xilin village on Xizhai mountain <span class="s12">梧塘西林西宅山</span>. Each year on lunar 9/6 the tombs are swept and rites are held in turn by the following three temples: Caizhai Daonanci <span class="s12">蔡宅道南祠</span>, the Shude- tang <span class="s12">樹德堂</span>, and the Caidai Shudetang <span class="s12">蔡埭樹德堂</span>.<span class="s9">9 </span>The leaders of the movement in Putian passed down through ten generations, all in the Cai lineage.<span class="s9">10 </span>In Putian, the Jintangjiao was often mistaken for an anti-Manchu, Ming restoration secret society, and the image of Cai Wenju was suspected by some officials of representing the Chongzhen Emperor (<span class="s12">崇禎皇帝</span>, or Chi Huangdi <span class="s12">赤皇帝 </span>(reigned 1627–44).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_111.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">8 </span>In these accounts, Dong and several others of Wang’s disciples manage to bribe their way into the prison where Wang had just died (in fact, Wang was released).

Deaths of fellow initiates are celebrated with the recitation of scriptures sending them home to their “true home”. The largest scale rites are called <i>manzhuo </i><span class="s12">满桌</span>, and involve collective performances by troupes of ritualists from several halls.

The numbers of halls in the Xinghua area is said to have been well over 100 in Republican times, with 130 currently active. Some of the better known temples are the Four Cai and Three Chen temples <span class="s12">四 蔡 三 陳 </span>. The four Cai temples are: 1) Shudetang <span class="s12">樹 德 堂 </span>, said to have been the first such temple in Putian, is located in Shangyu <span class="s12">上 俞 </span>village near Hanjiang. The temple has shrunk from its original nine halls to a single hall. 2) The Daonanci is in Caizhai Xiacuo <span class="s12">蔡 宅 下 厝 道 南 祠 </span>.

Some temples are close to extinction, such as the 4) Shudetang <span class="s12">樹德堂 </span>in Hanjiang Daili Caidai <span class="s12">涵江埭里蔡埭 </span>and the Shudeci Changlin Daba village <span class="s12">暢林大壩樹德祠</span>. By contrast, the three Chen temples (founded by descendants of Chen Zhizhai <span class="s12">陳直齋</span>) include the 1) Dabenci in Huangshi Huadi Donghua village<span class="s12">黃石華堤東華 大本祠 </span>which was restored in the late 1980s by Over- seas Chinese donations. 2) Libenci <span class="s12">立本祠 </span>in Tangtou village <span class="s12">塘頭 </span>near Hanjiang and 3) the Jianyuanci <span class="s12">見源祠 </span>in Xijiang <span class="s12">西江 </span>village near Hanjiang.

Over time, some forty-two Xiantianjiao temples were established in Xianyou and Putian counties, and many thousands were initiated. In Republican times, two temples were still active in the Hanjiang area, but the majority of the remaining Xiantianjiao are found in the Xiuyu<span class="s12">秀嶼鎮 </span>township area beyond Hushi and the further down the pen- insula away from the southern irrigated plain.

In this section, the names and locations of some well-known churches are provided.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Italian Catholic missionary Gulio Aleni <span class="s12">艾儒略 </span>was based in Fuzhou between 1625 and 1635, with the support of Prime Minister Ye Xianggao <span class="s12">葉向高</span>, a native of Fuqing. In 1632 a Catholic Church was built in Putian city, and 107 people were baptized. A collection of poems exchanged with Aleni entitled the <i>Minzhong zhugong zeng- shi </i><span class="s12">閩中諸公贈詩 </span>(<i>Poems sent by literati throughout Fujian</i>) includes sixty-seven literati, of whom six were from Putian. The beginnings of Chinese Christian statuary is traced to the Putian sculpture Zeng Jing<span class="s12">曾鯨</span>, cognomen Bochen <span class="s12">波臣 </span>(1568–1650). After the Qing Manchu conquest, a Hunanese Chinese convert surnamed Chen <span class="s12">陳 </span>estab- lished a village of his descendants in Dongmei, Pinghai <span class="s12">平海東美</span>, which remained Catholic for many generations. A Catholic church named the Hunantang <span class="s12">湖南堂 </span>was built there in 1871. Other Catholic churches were built in Pinghai and Nanri Island beyond the reaches of the irrigated alluvial plain in 1830, 1839, and 1846. In 1849 a Catholic church called the Hanjiangtang <span class="s12">涵江堂 </span>was built in the Putian plain in Tangbei <span class="s12">塘北 </span>village, and two other churches were built nearby in Daili <span class="s12">埭里 </span>village (Xijiangbiantang <span class="s12">西江邊堂</span>) and Caidai <span class="s12">蔡埭 </span>vil- lages. The Hanjiangtang remained the principal Catholic church in the Putian area. A Catholic church was built in Putian city in 1851. The first Catholic church in the southern irrigated plain was built in Dong- yang village <span class="s12">東洋堂 </span>outside Huangshi in 1899, and another was built the same year in Beigao <span class="s12">北高堂</span>. According to the <i>Putian zongjiaozhi caogao </i>(1991: 670, 677), there were fourteen Catholic churches and seventy-three properties belonging to the church after 1949. After the Cultural Revolution, fifty-two were left, and forty-eight of these prop- erties had been restored or returned to the Church in the early 1980’s. Some twenty churches have been reopened.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The <i>Putian zongjiaozhi caogao </i>(1991: 670, 678–682) also states that the Protestant churches had 138 churches and 189 additional prop- erties in Xianyou and Putian counties after 1949, and that after the Cultural Revolution 97 properties remained, of which 83 had been returned by 1990. These figures do not include more recently built churches of denominations such as the True Jesus church. Of those churches listed, perhaps fifteen are found within the irrigated Putian plain. These include the Kengbeitang <span class="s12">坑北堂 </span>in Hushi Liucuo Kengbei<span class="s12">劉厝坑北 </span>village, founded in 1892, the Meifengtang <span class="s12">梅鳳堂 </span>in Putian,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ritual specialists 175</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">founded in 1897, the Beigaotang <span class="s12">北高堂 </span>founded in 1901, the Qiao- doutang <span class="s12">僑兜堂 </span>founded in Qiaodou village near Huangshi in 1906, the Hushitang <span class="s12">笏石堂 </span>founded in 1908, the Shitingtang <span class="s12">石庭堂 </span>in Shixi <span class="s12">石西 </span>near Jiangkou founded in 1922, the Hanjiangtang <span class="s12">涵江堂 </span>founded in 1923, the Jiangkoutang <span class="s12">江口堂 </span>founded in 1923, the Tang- toutang <span class="s12">塘頭堂 </span>founded in Tangtou Xiangli <span class="s12">坑北巷利 </span>village near Hanjiang in 1926, another Hushitang <span class="s12">笏石堂 </span>founded in Tawei <span class="s12">塔尾 </span>village near Hushi in 1927, the Huangshitang <span class="s12">黃石堂 </span>founded in 1930, the Tianmatang <span class="s12">天馬堂 </span>founded in Tianma <span class="s12">天馬 </span>village near Huang- shi in 1931, and the Qingjiangtang <span class="s12">清江堂 </span>founded in Qingzhong<span class="s12">清中 </span>near Huangshi in 1935.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Protestant missionaries first came to Putian in the mid 1800s. The first Methodist Church was built in Pinghai in 1865, and a second church was built in Putian city in 1867. The best known Methodist minister in Putian was William Brewster (arrived in Putian in 1890, died 1917) and his energetic wife Elizabeth, who stayed on in Putian until 1951. They founded churches, hospitals, schools, charities, print- ing presses, telegraph lines, local shipping companies, and clothing and noodle factories. They were active in campaigns to eliminate opium cultivation, sale and use. In 1912 a group of 300 Chinese Protestants associated with Brewster immigrated to Sarawak in Indonesia to create a New Jerusalem (known as New Xinghua) in the jungle.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Anglican missionaries built a church in Houguan village just south of Hanjiang in 1876. The YMCA began work in the Xinghua area in the 1880s. Several other denominations were active in the region in the 1920s, including the True Jesus Church, and these groups also built churches in the Putian plains.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Many of the villages listed in the survey volume as having Christian communities will not necessarily have a church, as unofficial “house- hold churches” are widespread in Fujian and elsewhere in China. Gen- erally speaking, participation in Christian communities requires the family or individual to refrain from involvement with village temple cults. This can be the cause of some social friction, as temple funding is raised on a per capita basis and a large proportion of the funds go to pay for opera performances. In the current situation of rapidly reviv- ing village temple networks, it may be difficult or socially awkward to avoid contributing to these funds, especially if the individuals or fami- lies wish to attend the opera performances. Nonetheless, these families do not prepare offerings or greet the gods on procession with incense and fireworks. In only a very few instances, we observed painted signs</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">176 chapter five</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">on the walls of homes stating that the inhabitants would not worship the village gods. In another village near Beigao we found Catholic tal- ismans pasted on doorways or windows. In general, however, there is little outward sign of friction, and the Christian communities have been able in dozens of villages and towns to build Christian churches. The Christian churches tend to be large structures built, for the most part, in imitation of Western styles, using brightly tinted blue and green glass, with white-washed cement or tiled walls, and featuring tall spires mounted with crosses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER SIX</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">GODS AND CULTS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The survey found over 1500 differently named gods worshipped in the temples of the Putian plains. Of this number, some 300 names were variant names of gods, often revealing interesting differences of local understanding of a particular deity. This leaves some 1200 gods. This is clearly a staggering figure, and an expression of the enormous cultural complexity and creativity of the region. While a full account of all these deities, their legends, iconography, miracles, specialized rituals, and temples would require a separate volume, it is possible to propose some rough categories of analysis. Any typology of the gods is however complicated by the fact that every god is multivalent, both protective and potentially destructive. Although certain gods are closely identi- fied with specific trades (such as Mazu, frequently called the goddess of seafarers, or Tiangong yuanshuai, in Putian the god of theater wor- shipped by every opera and marionette troupe), these gods also have power over a broad range of activities once they are placed on an altar in a particular temple. These gods then take charge of all aspects of the life of their worshippers, who pray to them for assistance concerning a full panoply of life’s concerns including health, marriage, childbirth, schooling, investments, and the resolving of family disputes. Despite this functional multiplicity, it is still possible to create broad categories of gods, and to attempt to relate the history of their introduction into the Putian plains.</p><p

celebrations commemorated, as in the list below, the order and frequency of the gods changes in significant ways. With the exception of the god and goddess of the <i>shê</i>, who are honored in virtually every village with celebrations, other god’s have their birthdays celebrated in only about a third of the temples in which they are worshipped. In many temples,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 179</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">one god may have a <i>xingtai </i><span class="s12">行臺 </span>“a temporary altar”, a table set off in front and to the side of the main altar for spirit writing sessions. Usually this indicates that this deity possesses spirit mediums. It is sometimes difficult to guess which gods of the temple actively possess worshippers, as these deities are not necessarily placed on the cen- tral altar. In the following list, one notes the relative importance of Xuantian shangdi vis a vis the other gods of the local pantheon. Note also that Lin Longjiang is celebrated less often in village wide rituals, although his birthday and date of ascension are actively celebrated in Three in One temples across the Putian plain.</p><ol id="l5"><li><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Zunzhu mingwang 703</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Houtu furen 700</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Tiangong yuanshuai 189</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Xuantian shangdi/Yuantian shangdi 163</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Tianshang shengmu (including Mazu) 145</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Zhanggong shengjun 144</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Qitian dasheng 132</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Yanggong taishi 126</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -13pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Sanyi jiaozhu (Lin Longjiang) 115</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -19pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Guanyin 97</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -19pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Sima shengwang 86</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">13.

Even smaller proportions of deities receive birthday celebratory rituals. Nonethe- less, rituals are conducted virtually every day in village temples across the Putian plains for the deities of the enormous local pantheon.<span class="s9">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Although only a crude comparative method, the distributions of dif- ferent cults mapped out below do suggest the possibility of develop- ing even sharper analytic tools for the identification of very localized pantheons and sub-cultures. At the very least, these complex patterns of distribution of cults should lead us to treat with some caution talk of <i>jisiquan </i><span class="s12">祭祀圈 </span>(ritual spheres) dedicated to a particular deity, or <i>xinyangquan </i><span class="s12">信仰圈 </span>(belief spheres) extending to even broader dis- tributions of followers of a particular god (Lin 1988). The term ritual sphere has been defined differently by a number of scholars working in Taiwan, but in general the concept emphasizes a comprehensive approach to all the cult centers in a specific area, and does not focus attention on a single, defining deity worshipped in the region (see the overview of these studies in Zhang 1996). Although some regions of Taiwan, where this research has been pursued, may have temples with regionally prominent deities, there are still many different deities wor- shipped within any one region, and their cults should be examined in relation to all the others in a region, and in terms of patterns of distribution of particular cults translocally. Clearly, this is not a phe- nomenon unique to Taiwan, but instead an essential aspect of most local cultures of China.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The god worshipped as <i>Mingzhu zunwang </i><span class="s12">明主尊王 </span>(the Shining</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Ruler, Revered King) is found in almost every village on the plain, where his presence is a mark of ritual independence.

This god is also called the <i>shêzhu </i><span class="s12">社主</span>, or the god of the <i>Shê </i>(altar of the soil and the harvest). He is usually found alongside his wife, Lady <i>Houtu </i><span class="s12">后土</span>, in temples called <i>shê </i>or on side altars of joint <i>shêmiao. </i>One distinctive feature of the Putian pantheon is the relative rank and role of this deity. In Putian, this god is distinguished from <i>Tudigong </i><span class="s12">土地公</span>, the tutelary deity who is wor- shipped in most households in a little shrine set outside each house, usually on a low wall surrounding the courtyard. Both of these gods are also distinguished from <i>Fude zhengshen </i><span class="s12">福德正神</span>, another version of the earth god, who has many small neighborhood shrines (with open doors) in the villages of Putian. Thus there are at least three levels of shrines dedicated to local tutelary gods in this region, and each layer has its own history and distinct social level (the spread of individual households, the formation of neighborhoods, and the establishment of ritually independent villages). We can conclude that the cult of Min- gzhu zunwang is connected to the spread of <i>shêji </i>altars in the early Ming, and their mutation into the independent village ritual units of the ritual alliances from the mid-Ming onwards. Thus this form of the earth god takes on an even higher status through his association with official altars and the state cult, even though this specific representa- tion of the god has been appropriated locally for purposes of asserting village ritual independence.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">This situation contrasts for example to that of Taiwan, which was settled under the Qing, when official <i>lishê </i>altars were no longer estab- lished in each <i>li </i>sub-canton, and where the official altars of the earth god were no longer as powerful a symbol to be manipulated as they had been in the early Ming. <i>Tudigong </i>shrines could be set up any- where, as this kind of deity has a much more undifferentiated and immediate relationship with local ritual territories. The earth god in Taiwan is not a solemn official seated on a throne with imperial head- dress, but is instead the more familiar and ubiquitous figure of the old geezer with his white beard and cane, who sometimes is seen holding a bar of gold. He is firmly entrenched in the everyday life of Taiwanese neighborhoods (Dell’Orto 2004).</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">It is significant that some villages have more than one <i>shê </i>altar (or have multiple sets of Zunzhu mingwang and Houtu furen gods on different altars in a joint <i>shêmiao</i>), as these represent different ritual collectivities with distinct territories of the village or the alliance.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 29: Distribution of temples dedicated to Zunzhu mingwang and Houtu furen</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">182 chapter six</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="390" height="519" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_115.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 183</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Aside from these tutelary deities, Tiangong yuanshuai is the god most widely worshipped in the Putian plain, with statues in 500 temples. His legend is recounted in a ritual play performed by Xinghua mari- onettists, known as <i>Yuanxi </i><span class="s12">愿戲 </span>(theater of the repayment of vows). The god is the third son of the Jade Emperor. He is bored in heaven, bored by the endless bureaucracy, and longs to visit the human realm. At first he descends as a young woman, only to be accosted by a dog spirit. Reverting to his original form, he subdues the dog spirit who becomes the first of his sidekicks (the others are the lads of Wind and Fire). This dog-spirit can now be found in close to one hundred temples in Putian, where he is represented as white dog holding a flag in one hand, and is worshipped as General White Tooth (also known as General Numinous Tooth). Tiangong yuanshuai next decides to enter the womb of the wife of the Prime Minister in a home in Hang- zhou. Eighteen years later the Emperor finds his Empress afflicted with illness as a result of his having sent his armies against rebel forces, unleashing killer vectors into the air. A Daoist immortal disguised as a doctor explains that the Emperor must confess his crimes by wearing a yoke, or cangue, like a common criminal. The Prime Minister sug- gests that his son, who has just placed third (Tanhuayuan <span class="s12">探花院</span>) in the imperial exams, will come up with a solution. Indeed, the god has a brilliant idea, suggesting that either he, or some other officer, should wear the cangue in a substitutive act of penance. The plan works, and the empress is saved. The god then suggests that people throughout the empire should wear cangues to express atonement and that this should be supervised by the First Place Examination winner. The emperor is delighted with this plan, and orders up a banquet, where the god sings and dances, drinks and then passes out on the steps of the inner pal- ace. There he is discovered by the princess, who teases him by painting on his bright red face black lines of crab patterns coming out of his mouth (an important feature of his iconography in Putian). The god awakens and returns home. His sidekicks point out his altered appear- ance, but he cannot wash off the markings. At this point he receives a summons to return to heaven. However, the Jade Emperor is enraged by his appearance, and condemns the god to return to the human realm and to perform the story of his fall from grace on stages all over the world for all time. At this point, the sponsor of the play is put into a cangue and made to join the puppets while a memorial outlining his transgressions and act of penance is read out by the chief marionet- tist. Finally he is freed from the cangue, which is burned along with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">184 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the memorial to conclude the ritual play. This enactment of the legend of the god condemned to perform his own story forever is the most compelling local expression of the cultural requirement that everyone must fulfill their own ritual role to the best of their performative abil- ity. In Putian, the god of theater is the master of music and dance, as well as a powerful exorcistic deity capable of spreading as well as dispelling plague. This god frequently possesses spirit mediums in the Putian plains.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The main temple of the cult of Tiangong yuanshuai on the Putian plain is the Ruiyunmiao, just outside the East Gate of Putian city. A Qing dynasty stage has been “preserved” by being placed above a concrete stage facing the temple. Over forty temples from Putian and Xianyou counties come to present incense to this temple on the birth- day of the god. This kind of cult pattern, featuring a central, founding temple, which receives incense from branch temples (through <i>fen- xiang </i><span class="s12">分香 </span>division of incense, is a well-known feature of Chinese local religion (Dean 1993; Schipper 1990, Lagerwey, et al., 1994–).<span class="s9">2 </span>How- ever, many temples dedicated to Tiangong yuanshuai, or temples with the god as a secondary deity, are independent of this division of incense network.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The god is worshipped as the patron deity of actors. Every opera, marionette and puppet troupe carry a portable version of the god to every stage, and worship him with incense and offerings prior to each performance. For more elaborate rites, and for performances of the Mulian ritual operas, an actor dressed as the god purifies the stage with special pacings and the burning of talismans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_116.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">2 <span class="s7">Another common pattern involves the rotation of the statue of a god between the temples in an alliance, as in the case of Dingguangfo discussed in Lagerwey (1998). This pattern sometimes leads to the division of a temple into several independent, linked temples, as occurred in a ritual alliance near Hanjiang in the Qianlong (1736–</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">95) period. Yet another pattern is the procession around the temples of the alliance of the gods of the commonly shared, higher order alliance temple. In the latter case, which is quite common in Putian, certain temples “receive the gods” for the night over the course of a multi-day procession. There are many historical factors underlying the hierarchies of these events, including the date of the founding temple and the history of the expansion of villages within the alliance. These factors account for issues of precedence, seniority, and sequence in processions and rituals (compare Allio 1999). The different patterns of movement within local cults can be extremely hierarchical or open to transformation. One way to generate change in such a system is by developing ever higher order temples, such as the temples dedicated to Yuhuang dadi which have been used to generate new connections across regional alliances.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 185</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Tiangong yuanshuai is also identified in local scriptures (of the Three in One) as the Commander in Chief of the Ministry of Exor- cism. He is responsible for driving away plague demons, but also for spreading the plague to those who deserve it. Like many deities, he has both a protective and a destructive side.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The presence of a Three in One temple is every other village in the Putian plains is a testimony to the spread of this movement dedicated to the grafting of Daoist inner alchemy and Buddhist meditation onto a Confucian basis of moral self-cultivation. Elsewhere, the spread of the Three in One within Putian is recounted in some detail (Dean 1998). Several sub-sects of the movement formed, and there are a number of identifiable sectors on the plain in which these groups are distributed. In recent years, temples within these sectors have held gatherings of all the Three in One temples in the region. Invitations are exchanged, and Daoyou <span class="s12">道友 </span>(friends of the Way), or representatives from each temple attend and participate in the ritual celebrations. A very busy schedule of annual ritual activities is generated in this way, and many Three in One temples post the annual calendar of these ritual events, or at least provide a list of sites for the performance of the <i>Zhongyuan </i>or <i>Xiayuan Pudu </i>rites within a given sector of the Putian plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The cult of Xuantian shangdi is widely distributed across the Putian plain. The wide spread of temples dedicated to this deity is likely linked to the support of the Ming court for the god, and in Putian to the defeat of the pirate armies of the mid Ming period. This cult is also tied to the rise of merchant coalitions, and the relatively high concentra- tion of Xuantian shangdi temples in the northeast corner of the plain (the Jiuliyang region) is likely a result of the late rise of commercialism in that area. This deity, along with Mazu, is linked in many parts of Southeast China to rising merchant success. Perhaps the rise of and spread of the cult in Jiangkou can also be linked to the rapid improve- ment in the prosperity of this town in the late Qing and Republican periods. Jiangkou became a town in the Qing by merging several fish- ing villages together. Return investments started to flow into the town from immigrants to Southeast Asia in the late 19th century. In one of the temples of Jiangkou town, the new merchant elite set up a statue of Xuantian shangdi and cast out the farmers and fishermen they found no longer to their liking. These latter were forced to set up a new temple to the north of Jiangkou town.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">That Mazu or Tianshang shengmu (Tianhou) is worshipped in 273</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">temples is no surprise, as her founding temple is on Meizhou island</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 30: Distribution of temples dedicated to Tiangong yuanshuai</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">186 chapter six</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="388" height="515" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_117.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 31: Distribution of Three in One temples dedicated to Lin Longjiang</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 187</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="384" height="515" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_118.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 32: Distribution of temples dedicated to Xuantian shangdi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">188 chapter six</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="404" height="542" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_119.gif"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 33: Distribution of temples dedicated to Mazu (Tianshang shengmu)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 189</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="386" height="519" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_120.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">190 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">in Meizhou Bay, just south of Xinghua Bay. Song inscriptions record her cult in Fujian. As her cult expanded and received more and more official recognition, a broader cross-section of people from across the Putian plain began to worship her. Ming and Qing frescoes outlining episodes of her legends survive in a number of temples in Xianyou and Putian (Ruitenbeek 1999). In recent years, the goddess has been dubbed the Goddess of Peace by the Taiwan Affairs Bureau in an effort to reach out to Taiwanese worshippers, who flock to the founding temple on Meizhou island. This recent political legitimacy of the cult has led to many temples in the Putian plains adding new statues of the goddess onto their altars, thus adding additional guarantees of the legitimacy of their activities (see also Jiang 1990; Watson 1985).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The goddess Chen Jinggu, who is commonly referred to as Tianqian shengmu, and who is often worshipped as part of the Lufu Bureau of Smallpox pantheon in many temples in the Putian plain, is a goddess from Gutian, north of Fuzhou, whose cult dates back to the Song. Her legend has been recounted above. Her legend thus links her to the fertility of Fujian region, and she is especially well known for her help to women during childbirth, or to infants threatened by disease. Local marionette ritual plays such as the Beidouxi <span class="s12">北斗戲 </span>(Northern Dipper play) and the Luxi <span class="s12">魯戲 </span>(Smallpox play) are performed in the Putian area, and local Daoist ritual masters can perform Smallpox <i>Lujiao</i><span class="s12">魯醮 </span>offering services in which the goddess is repeatedly invoked. She, like Zhanggong shengjun, is also worshipped as the founding goddess of a Daoist ritual tradition, known as Lüshan <span class="s12">閭山 </span>or Sannai <span class="s12">三奶</span>. Traces of this ritual tradition can be found in Putian Daoist traditions. For example, the <i>Tanban </i>altar associates are placed under the protec- tion of the Lushan Dafayuan <span class="s12">廬山大法院</span>.<span class="s9">3 </span>Her legends are recounted in many forms across Fujian and southern China, in sung invocations, scriptures, liturgies, marionette plays, <i>changben</i>, novels, murals, and even television shows in Taiwan. Elements of her legend are acted out in the rites of the Lüshan Daoist ritual tradition which flourishes in parts of western Fujian and northeast Guangdong.<span class="s9">4 </span>In Putian however,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_121.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">3 </span>Note that in many ritual texts of the Putian plains, the character for Lüshan<span class="s16">閭山</span>, the mountain linked to the legend of Chen Jinggu, is written with the character for Lushan <span class="s16">盧山</span>, the mountain in Jiangxi instead.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">4 </span>There is a growing literature on Chen Jinggu and the Lüshan ritual tradition.

The widespread cult of Guanyin is a well known phenomenon across China, and the cult of Qitian dasheng can be attributed to the popularity of Ming novels and plays based on version of the <i>Journey to the West</i>, but many of the other gods all have a distinctly local inflec- tion. The iconography of Qitian dasheng is quite unique. In Putian he appears as an aged ape with a red face and white whiskers. This god also frequently possesses mediums. Clearly a full recounting of the his- tory of the cults and the legends and miracles of the many gods of the Putian plains is beyond the scope of this introduction. Nonetheless, one can discern the following categories of gods, and place them in a rough chronological progression in relation to changing social and economic forces.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Early cults of irrigation  founders</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This category includes figures such as Li Hong (Li Zhangzhe) and Lady Qian (Qianshi shengfei), associated with the Mulan Weir. The cult of Wu Xing, founder of the Yanshou Weir, is important in the northern irrigated plain. The founders of the Nanan Weir are worshipped in the Donglaisi in the Jiuliyang irrigation system near Jiangkou.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The <i>Map of the Distribution of Wushi shengfei </i>shows the tem- ples dedicated to the sister of Wu Xing, the Saintly Maiden Wu. As explained above, she is credited with many miracles and magical acts in the area around the Yanshou Weir, founded in the 780s. Over thirty temples in that area worship her image, usually alongside other gods. Another interesting pocket of worship of this goddess is found in temples near the Mulan Weir. Perhaps these temples with images of the Saintly Maiden Wu show an awareness of the roles of Wu Xing, along with Lady Qian and Li Zhangzhe, in creating the early irrigation systems of the Putian plains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_125.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;">and related ritual marionette traditions in Western Fujian, see Ye Mingsheng, 1995; 1996; 2000; 2008; Ye and Liu 1997; Ye and Wu 1997.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 37: Distribution of temples dedicated to Wu shengfei</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 195</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="392" height="520" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_126.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">196 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One can trace the cults of Li Zhangzhe and Lady Qian up and down the main channel of the Mulan Weir in the southern irrigated plain. Li Zhangzhe is worshipped in temples at the beginning and end of the main channel of the Mulan Weir, just beyond Huangshi town. Sites such as Dayu would have marked the shoreline in the Song, and so it is understandable that Li Zhangzhe would be worshipped in temples there. There are also statues of him in temples in several villages along the Mulan river, and in the large villages along the sea dike to the south of the mouth of the Mulan river. Both of these sets of villages are settled on land reclaimed during the Ming, thanks to secondary canals drawing water from the main channel dug by Li Hong and the Four- teen Surnames. Although the villages along the Mulan riverside, and those along the sea struggled over access to water within the southern irrigation system, both claimed the right to worship the founder of the system.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Lady Qian is also worshipped in villages all along and at the end of</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the main channel of the Mulan irrigation system dug in the Song on the southern irrigated plain, but there is also a separate network of temples dedicated to her as the principal deity, or with a statue of Lady Qian on a side altar, in the villages near the Mulan Weir, where her corpse is said to have floating after she drowned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Early strata of local  gods</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Certain gods and goddesses have an early connection to local history and cultic life in the Putian plains. These include the goddess Chen Jinggu and her headquarters in the Bureau of Smallpox, the Lufu; Zhanggong shengjun and Fazhu Xianfei, Mazu, later promoted to Tian- fei <span class="s12">天妃 </span>(Imperial Concubine) and ultimately to Tianhou (Empress of Heaven), the Five Emperors Wuhuang <span class="s12">五皇 </span>(widely worshipped in the Fuzhou area (Song 2006) and Tiangong yuanshuai (in his local version the cult may go back to Song times, though epigraphical mate- rials are available only from the Ming).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Zhanggong shengjun is a Daoist exorcist who is worshipped as Fazhugong, and is considered the founder of a local Daoist ritual tra- dition in nearby Dehua <span class="s12">德化</span>, Yongchun <span class="s12">永春 </span>and Nan’an <span class="s12">南安</span>.

Many of the latter were early Buddhist missionaries, who subdued the local inhabitants, their gods, and their symbols through magical battles, later incorporating their magical powers and abilities. In the case of figures like Mazu, who may have been an illiterate spirit medium and most likely was a <i>Danmin </i>herself, or the bareheaded and barefooted Zhanggong sheng- jun, or Chen Jinggu and her prayers for rain, we appear to be deal- ing again with local, possibly non-Han spirit medium cults that have developed into more complex liturgical forms in interaction with early Daoist ritual specialists. This is a highly complex issue that will require further research. However, it is clear that the quick increase in reg- istered households over the course of the Song dynasty involved the increasing inclusion of different ethnic groups into the Han Chinese imperial system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nature gods and earth gods in Putian</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One might imagine that local spirits of the earth would represent the most fundamental unit of Chinese local ritual space. To some degree this is true, in that almost every house with a walled courtyard in the Putian plain includes a small shrine to the Tudigong (god of the earth), and most neighborhoods have small, open-doored shrines to a slightly higher level version of the god, Fude zhengshen. Finally, village level temples have altars dedicated to the Zunzhu mingwang and Houtu furen. However, as shown above, the particular position of these gods in the Putian local pantheon is a product of a historical process that includes imperial efforts to reconfigure local ritual practice and local mutations of these same efforts in the evolution of a new form of ritual power as seen in the ritual alliances of the Putian plain. Thus rather than assuming a structural priority to these gods of the earth, and attributing them a fixed role within an unchanging pantheon, with a set iconography and ritual practices, one must instead examine them in the light of a historically shifting field of forces including imperial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">200 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">reforms and local transformations. The cult of Zunzhu mingwang and Houtu furen in contemporary Putian can be traced to the early Ming <i>lishê </i>altars. Their subsequent mutation into one of the genera- tive aspects of the current distribution of ritual alliances is a key theme in the history of local socio-cultural organization from the mid-Ming onwards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Official cults and local  uses</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Of course official cults and gods symbolizing orthodox values did play an important role in the evolution of the Putian pantheon. The <i>You Song Xinghuajun Xiangyingmiaoji </i><span class="s12">有宋興化軍祥應廟記 </span>from 1138 discussed above describes how a local god was canonized in reward for his miracles by Emperor Huizong <span class="s12">徽宗</span>, and how various high officials from the Fang lineage sought to participate in and promote Confucian rites reminiscent of the ancient wine-drinking ceremony that would emphasize principles of hierarchy and social order within the communal rituals of the temple. But as Clark (2007:193) points out, the author of the stele inscription was aware that Buddhist and Daoist rites remained important aspects of the rituals of the cult. The god of this temple has long since disappeared, and the Fang lineage also  gradually  lost  prominence  in  the  village.  Currently  the  village temple is dedicated to Xuantian shangdi, and the Fangs are no lon- ger a major lineage in the village. This is just one example of the rise and fall of local cults and their associated social backers, which must have been repeated thousands of times in the Putian plains (see Clark 1995).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Prefectural City God temple in Putian was built in 1370, as part of an empire-wide plan to establish official city god temples in administrative centers. The temple was restored by resident Daoist ritual masters in the Ming, judging by inscriptions carved in still extant stone pillars in 1631.<span class="s9">5 </span>There was both a Prefectural and a District City</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_129.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">5 </span>These inscriptions read: Daoists Yang Daguan, Huang Zhen, Chen Zhenyuan, Guo Ji, and Zheng Xuan together raised funds to build (the hall), dated 1631, in autumn, on an auspicious day <span class="s16">道士楊大琯</span>, <span class="s16">黃鎮</span>, <span class="s16">陳貞元</span>, <span class="s16">郭稷</span>, <span class="s16">鄭璇 仝募建。 崇禎四年歲次辛未季秋吉旦</span>. The <i>Minguo Putianxianzhi</i>, compiled by Zhang Qin in 1945, records several restorations and expansions of the temple undertaken by Daoist ritual masters at the order of various district magistrates. These include Xiao Xihu Heyefu Daoist <span class="s16">小西湖荷葉付道士 </span>who was put in charge of the incense lamps (i.e.,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 201</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">God temple (both have survived, but the Prefectural City God temple was turned into a hospital after Liberation, and has only very slowly been rebuilding itself around the corner from the hospital, beginning in the mid-1990s, whereas the District City God temple, located near the northwest corner of the city, has been active since the early 1980s). In such temples, during the Ming dynasty, the Daoist ritual masters participated in orthodox imperial rites on the one hand, and on the other hand presided over a hierarchy of dozens of local temples located within the city walls of Putian.<span class="s9">6 </span>Up into the Republican period, the City God of Putian was carried in a great procession to many of the temples and neighborhoods of the city. The god also went outside the Southern and Eastern city gates to visit temples in villages clus- tered close to the moat around the city.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">There were also City God temples in the four walled forts along the Putian coast. One of these, the City God of Puxi <span class="s12">莆 禧 </span>, was moved during the Qing coastal evacuation, to Hanjiang, an emerging com- mercial center at the time. After the coastal evacuation had been lifted, the god refused to return, and so Hanjiang got a City God temple, which is still very active in the area. The City God temple management</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">committee is made up of representatives of each of the twenty-four wards of Hanjiang town. The festivities at <i>Yuanxiao </i>at this temple are spectacular, as processions from each of these communities pay ritual visits to the temple, and opera performances go on for over a month. Every three years, a procession arrives from Puxi, which has rebuilt its own City God temple, but which nonetheless recognizes the historical connection to Hanjiang.<span class="s9">7 </span>Curiously, one also finds occasional City</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_130.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">running the temple) in 1575, Daoist master Zheng Wenbing <span class="s16">鄭文炳 </span>who built a tower and added statues of the Eighteen Offices in 1606, and in the Qing dynasty in 1700, the Daoist master Yao Yuzun <span class="s16">姚於尊</span>, who built a storehouse for the temple. The temple was saved from destruction under the “Destroy Superstition” campaign of 1929 by local leaders who pointed out that heroic figures of anti-Mongol resistance such as Chen Wenlong <span class="s16">陳文龍 </span>were worshipped in the temple.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">6 <span class="s7">Taylor 1990 comments on the dual roles of the Daoist officiants of the City God temples in the Ming.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">7 </span>The Yuanxiao rituals at the City God temple of Puxi (a fortified town near the sea, beyond the irrigated Putian plain) include a ladder of swords fifty feet high which is climbed by a medium in trance. The medium scatters coins and talismans from the top of the sword ladder. A great procession carries the City God and its entourage through the narrow streets of the walled fort, and the <i>luzhu </i>(incense burner hosts) hold massive feasts to which scores of visitors are invited.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">202 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">God temples in smaller villages—perhaps the result of spirit medium possession.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Many of the gods worshipped in the Putian plains represent quali- ties of orthodoxy, if not nationalism. These include Sima shengwang or Zhang Xun <span class="s12">張巡 </span>(708–757), a Tang hero who died resisting An Lushan, and Chen Wenlong <span class="s12">陳文龍</span>, a Song loyalist who died in 1276 while resisting the Mongols. Both serve as a symbols of imperial ortho- doxy in the Putian area. The former god’s iconography is that of a young scholar-literati official.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Of course, Guandi, the paragon of loyalty, is worshipped in many temples. Another set of gods associated with orthodox values and Confucian academies are Wenchang dijun and Kuidou. Some of these gods are also worshipped in altars inside Three in One temples. Even Confucius and Zhu Xi are worshipped in some popular god temples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: center;">Mid-Ming popular gods—Qitian dasheng, Puji shenghou (Zhu Bajie <span class="s12">豬八戒</span>) and Xuantian shangdi</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The group of gods whose popularity is reflected in the popular plays and novels of the mid to late Ming include Qitian dasheng and Puji shenghou (Xiyuoji <span class="s12">西游記</span>) and Xuantian shangdi (Beiyouji <span class="s12">北游記</span>). In addition to these popular versions of the god’s legend, Xuantian shangdi also received an important imperial cult in the Ming, and in the Putian area was also understood as interceding against pirate raids and containing the aggrieved dead. Another related deity is Yanggong taishi, the famous fighting monk brother of the Yangjiajiang <span class="s12">楊家將 </span>family of warrior women who came down from Wutaishan <span class="s12">五臺山 </span>Mountain to join his sisters in battle. In the Putian area he is repre- sented as a fierce monk with golden face and bulging eyes, leaning forward and grasping a club above his head. His cult is concentrated in the southern irrigated plain, where he serves as the main god for several local ritual alliances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Wangye <span class="s12">王爺 </span>and Daren <span class="s12">大人 </span>gods</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Another class of deities particularly prominent in the coastal region “beyond the borders” of the Qing coastal evacuations are the Wangye gods (who both spread and dispel the plague) that are found along the coast and rivers of central and Southeast China. One of the most</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 203</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">prominent is Kong Daren, whose cult is centered in Houji <span class="s12">后 積 </span>vil- lage in Beigao township. The god is said by some to have been a Qing dynasty general who died fighting off the pirate armies. Many of the temples in these <i>jiewai </i>villages feature Daren (Great Officials) in Qing costume. Some of these may have been local commanders who pro- tected particular villages against the pirates, or against inclusion in the coastal evacuation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Minnan gods and regional emigration</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Several gods worshipped in the Putian plains can be traced to neigh- boring cultural regions. These include some of the main gods of the Minnan area, often linked to emigrating surname groups who entered the Xinghua area in the mid-Ming or later. These are Baosheng Dadi<span class="s12">保生大帝 </span>or Ciji zhenjun <span class="s12">慈濟真君</span>, whose founding temples are near Xiamen, and Guangze zunwang <span class="s12">廣澤尊王</span>, whose founding temple is in Shishan <span class="s12">詩山 </span>in upper Nanan county (Schipper 1990; Dean 1993).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Local inventions and spirit mediums</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">We have already mentioned above the Lu Shixian (Immortal Lu) cults of Jiulidong as an example of locally invented deities linked to spirit medium cults. That particular cult arose in the late Qing, and can be linked to the spread of Xinghua communities across Southeast Asia (see below). Similar cults have no doubt been revealed or invented repeatedly throughout the cultural history of the Putian plains. This fundamental openness to revelation of new gods and cosmological powers is one of the most significant aspects of the evolving open sys- tem of Xinghua local culture.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Clearly these categories only begin to scratch the surface of the cosmological typologies of the Putian plains. Further research will be needed to improve on this rough sketch of early cults dating to the Song, including some with quite specific functions, early Ming official cults of the City God and the earth gods of the sub-cantons which were transformed into new representations within a new “ritual power” formation, popular gods introduced by empire wide popular cultural diffusion in the mid to late Ming, local self-cultivation and ritual traditions such as the Three in One which re-interpreted the pantheon in ways appropriate to its own vision from the late Ming</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">204 chapter six</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">through the Qing, and later cults revealed to spirit mediums in the late Qing and early Republican period. The only recently deified figure we have not yet found worshipped in the Putian plains is Mao Zedong. Cults to Mao have been reported in many parts of China, from Anhui to Zhejiang to Hunan, but so far we have not found the Chairman on an altar in a Putian temple. However, his talisman is often seen hang- ing from mirrors in taxicabs and minivans. His temples cannot be far behind.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Patterns of Distribution</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The distributions of the gods correspond to broad cultural differences on the Putian plain. If we begin with the villages indicated as currently containing an ancestral hall on <i>Map 10: Ancestral Halls: including Song and Ming sites </i>(see <i>Color Plates</i>), we can assume that these villages may have a somewhat stronger elite literati “Confucian cultural heri- tage”. Let us take this as our base map for comparison with the distri- bution of other deities and cultural features. Note that the northeast corner of the plain, the center of the <i>Tanban </i>collective spirit medium altar associations, is very lightly affected by the presence of ancestral halls. One might hypothesize that a different and distinct set of deities would be more popular in that area. This is in fact the case, with gods such as Tiangong yuanshuai, Qitian dasheng, Puji shenghou, and the Four Marshalls Kang, Ma, Zhao, and Wen Yuanshuai making more frequent appearances in this area. Thus we can identify a sub-cultural region within the Putian plains marked by the relative absence of lin- eage halls and the presence of discrete ritual traditions and a particular set of deities.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As we have seen, some gods are very broadly distributed across the Putian plain, so that no correlation can be found with a specific regional sub-culture. This is true for the distribution of Zunzhu ming- wang and Houtu furen, the god and goddess of the <i>shê </i>altar temples of Putian. They are found in virtually every village that is a self-sufficient, independent ritual unit. The cult of Lin Longjiang (founder of the Three in One movement) is also very widespread, and is found in approximately half the villages of the Putian plain. Other widespread cults are those to Tiangong yuanshuai and Chen Jinggu. In the case of Tiangong, one notes a denser distribution in the northern irrigated plain, and especially around Jiangkou, which may indicate this god’s</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gods and cults 205</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">propensity for spirit possession. Tianshang shengmu is widely distrib- uted as well, but note that there are more of her temples in the south- ern plain, which is closer to her mother temple on Meizhou Island. Major cults like those of Zhanggong shengjun also seem to be fairly evenly distributed, but note that the cult of Yanggong taishi is more densely located in the southern irrigated plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Some gods are clearly identified with specific regions. The cult of Li Zhangzhe and Lady Qian is restricted to the southern irrigated plain. By contrast, the cult of Wu xianfei, the sister of Wu Xing, founder of the Yanshou Weir irrigation system of the northern plain, is found only on the northwest sector of the plain, near the Taihe temple of Wu Xing. Turning to Qitian shenghou and Puji Shenghou, or as they are better known, Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie, we note a quite strong dis- tribution in the northeast sector of the plain. In the case of Zhu Bajie (Puji shenghou) there is almost no overlap with the distribution of ancestral halls. However, the cult of the gluttonous pig is also not that widely followed in the Jiangkou area, which has grown wealthy due to remittances from Overseas Chinese emigrants. The Monkey and the Pig pair are found together mostly in the temples of the poorer inland hill country of the northern plain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">TEMPLES, MONASTERIES AND PROCESSIONS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Buddhist monasteries and Daoist  temples</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">An exhaustive list of Buddhist monasteries, pagodas, and nunneries is included in the <i>Putian zongjiaozhi caogao </i>(1991). According to this source, there were 656 Buddhist monasteries, nunneries and halls in Putian and Xianyou after 1949. After the Cultural Revolution, only 382 buildings were left (89 monasteries and 293 nunneries and halls). Since 1980, 343 of these have been restored.

About half of the monasteries that have disappeared did so over the past centuries for a wide variety of reasons. The other half vanished after 1949, and especially during the Cultural Revolution. The final published version of the gazetteer, the <i>Putian xianshi</i>, 1994, included only half of this information. Unfortunately, the section in the draft volume on Daoist temples is not nearly so thorough, reflecting the definitional confusion discussed in Chapter Two above, and the lack of an active organization working for the cause of the reclamation of local temple properties. Only some sixty temples are listed, and while these include a few with early Daoist affiliations, the majority are distinguished more by their local prominence than by any relation to Daoism. In general, local gazetteers of all ages provide very sketchy information on local temples. Very few can be relied upon for anything close to a comprehensive survey. Only the most important temples in terms of official recognition, local power, historical significance or scenic beauty are listed. Some gazetteers go so far as to explain that their editors (such as the editor of the [Kangxi] <i>Ningxia xianzhi </i>gazetteer) have worked to improve the language of the stone inscriptions found at these temples. The recorded inscriptions in the gazetteers almost invariably omit the financial contributions of various patrons.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">2 </span>As these sources sometimes provide information the survey team was unable to gather, we have added information from this list into the survey below (indicating in each case that their information is drawn from the <i>Putian zongjiaozhi caogao </i>(1991)).

These lists also record the date of restoration or rebuilding of many of these monasteries in the 1980s. These restorations were the cul- mination of a process of the reclaiming of property rights from the government, after the temples had been converted into warehouses, if not torn down, during the Cultural Revolution. In some cases, fund- ing came from Overseas Chinese Buddhist temples associated with the founding monastery in Putian. During the late Qing and up to the late 1950’s, monks from Putian were sent to Southeast Asia to set up subsidiary monasteries. Several of these monks, or their disciples, were active in the restoration process.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">Currently, an impressive number of large Buddhist monasteries can be found in the mountains surrounding the Putian plains, or occasionally in an open area between irrigation canals in the fields in between villages. These include the Guanghuasi </span>廣化寺<span class="p">, founded in 558, and located near the south gate of Putian, the Guishansi </span>龜山寺<span class="p">, founded in 822, in Huating township, the Nangshansi </span>囊山寺<span class="p">, founded in 875, at the center of the rim of mountains on the north side of the Putian plain, the Meifengsi </span>梅峰寺<span class="p">, founded in 1104 in Putian city, the Gufengsi </span>鼓峰寺 <span class="p">founded in 1127 several kilometers to the west of Jiangkou, and the Shishisi </span>石室寺 <span class="p">to the west of Putian city.

These are positioned by the sides or on the mid-way point of bridges, recalling the role of Buddhist monastic estates in developing the infrastructure of the Putian plains. In addi- tion, lay Buddhist groups have set up numerous shrines to Guanyin, and Shijia mouni <span class="s8">釋迦牟尼 </span>is worshipped in a smaller number of Bud- dhist temples.

Three in One temples also frequently include statues of Guanyin, Rulai, or Shijiamouni as part of their syncretic worship. Guanyin also can be found in the back hall of many local village temples.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Many small nunneries have been set up in the villages of the Putian plain by elderly female Overseas Chinese patrons. These are tended by one or two nuns, who support themselves with handicrafts, and who often raise abandoned girls from the village. As these are private shrines dedicated to the worship of the founding patron, other villagers seldom enter, and the nuns and children live almost invisible lives. In some villages in recent years, much larger and sometimes quite osten- tatious Buddhist monasteries and nunneries have been built, usually with Overseas Chinese funding.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">As for Daoist temples, the term is no longer relevant in Putian, as nowadays Daoist ritual masters work out of their homes, where they have altars dedicated to Daoist deities. The main Daoist temple in Putian was the Yuanmiaoguan <span class="s8">元妙觀</span>, which was built in 1009. The temple was originally named the Tianqingguan <span class="s8">天慶觀</span>. Various imperial plaques and honors were bestowed on the temple in 1017. In 1119 Emperor Huizong bequeathed a stele in his own calligraphy renaming the temple the Shenxiao Wanshougong <span class="s8">神霄萬壽宮</span>.<span class="s9">3 </span>This stele is still preserved in the stelae garden behind the temple. The tem- ple was repaired in 1407, and again by Daoist masters Fang Rudiao<span class="s8">方汝調 </span>and Li Zhisheng <span class="s8">李志升 </span>in 1556. Further repairs took place in 1564. The temple complex included a Dongyueguan <span class="s8">東嶽觀 </span>(Temple to the Eastern Peak) and a Wuxianmiao <span class="s8">五顯廟 </span>(Five Manifestations Temple), along with a Xiyueguan <span class="s8">西嶽觀 (</span>Western Peak Temple), a Wenchang Temple, and a temple dedicated to Xuantian shangdi that was built due to the efforts of a Daoist master named Chen Maorui<span class="s8">陳茂瑞</span>. A famous mural displaying 100 scenes of the tortures of the Underworld were painted in western corridors of the temple in the Qing by Wu Zhongxi <span class="s8">吳仲熙</span>. By 1907, parts of the temple were con- verted into a modern style school. In 1930, the entire temple was taken over and used by the local government as office buildings. The paint- ings were covered with boards. Nowadays, only the Dongyueguan Temple of the Eastern Peak remains, and it has been converted into the Putian Historical Museum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_133.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">3 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 11, p. 9.

The Sanqingdian <span class="s8">三 清 殿 </span>(Hall of the Three Pure Ones) was the main hall of the temple. This hall is still preserved in a middle school (where it serves as the school library). The hall is an important example of Yuan architectural history.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As in other parts of China, Daoist ritual masters would also have had centers in the City God temples and at the Temples of the Eastern Peak outside Putian (Taylor 1990). In recent years, Daoist Association offices have been set up at the Dongyueguan (Temple of the Eastern Peak) of Jiangkou and at the Beichengong near Huangshi.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The functions of the village  temples</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: right;">Contemporary temples in the Putian plains serve as cultural centers and centers of political and economic decision making. Each village has its own system of selection of members of the temple management committee. Most rotate in new members based on criteria of age, mar- ital status, and sometimes the birth of male children into the man’s household. A few of these men are selected each year as the <i>Fushou </i><span class="s8">福首 </span>(fortunate headsmen) who will play a major role in both organizing and acting in the rituals of the year. Financial considerations enter into the picture, as the <i>fushou </i>often are expected to pay for feasts, offer- ings, rituals, and operas during their tenure. In many villages, people are so eager to perform these functions that they will borrow funds from family and friends in order to afford the honor. In some villages, selections are made by dropping divining blocks and waiting for the indications of the gods. Many villages give honorary membership in the temple committee to <i>xianglao </i><span class="s8">鄉老 </span>(village elders)—which may mean any man over fifty-five or sixty. These temple committees select representatives who participate in higher-order temple committees, which resemble United Nations assemblies of temple representatives. Temple committees are responsible for fund raising, organizing the ritual event, security and the maintenance of order during the event, liaison with local government and public security, invitations and hosting of visiting delegations and performing arts troupes, hiring of ritual specialists and opera troupes and ritual musicians, mobilizing the village population to participate in the processions of the gods,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples, monasteries and processions 211</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">which involves preparing costumes, banners, god’s umbrellas, and god’s sedan chairs (which can cost a small fortune when intricately carved out of sandalwood and covered in gold leaf ), the organization and sometimes the training of local spirit mediums, coordination of offerings, accounting for all income and expenditures, and provision- ing everyone with food, tea and cigarettes, and appropriate gifts. Each of these tasks is complex. For example, raising funds for the ritual involves paying visits to each household ahead of the ritual event to collect a small per-capita donation, and the raising of voluntary contributions from wealthy villagers, local companies, Overseas Chi- nese relations, and even from associations that represent the “floating population” of workers and laborers from outside the province. Some temples rent out shops or have other forms of property. Some have investment accounts at local banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Annual expenses of a temple cover the costs of daily maintenance, the costs of <i>yuanxiao </i>and <i>lanpen pudu </i>rituals (1/15 and 7/15), and the costs of birthday celebrations for the gods. Some temples post annual accounts, others post accounts for specific events as they take place. Certain temples even have printed sheets listing each household by name and leaving spaces for contribution amounts. There are of</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">course many more expenses involved in the construction or repair of a temple, and subscription sheets allow villagers to sign up for the support of specific items in the new temple (columns, beams, carved windows or pillars, lanterns, and lintels.).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Average expenditures for a ritual event have grown over the past three decades. These range from small temple celebrations with incomes of several hundred yuan to larger temples bringing in several hundred thousand yuan annually. A comprehensive analysis of these figures is being prepared. Based on several hundred temple account posters gathered in the mid 1990’s, the average personal contribu- tion per ritual event was around 20 yuan. Many other social groups and units also made contributions, from households, to production brigades, to ritual territories, to ritual associations (shares), to facto- ries, to Oveseas Chinese. Contributions range from small per capita amounts to substantial donations in the hundreds of thousands of yuan. A rough average cost for smaller birthdays of the gods at that time was in the range of three thousand yuan. Some special rites cost much more. One ritual held at the Beichengong (Temple of the North- ern Asterism) near Huangshi in the mid-‘90s cost over 40,000 yuan, with 18,000 going to the first performance in decades of the Mulian</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">212 chapter seven</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ritual opera by human actors. Even more spectacular <i>guanjie </i>collective spirit medium training rituals which go on for over a week have in recent years involved expenditures of approximately 400,000 yuan.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Roughly two thirds of the funds raised for most ritual events are used for the opera performances. An opera troupe may have forty members. The pay per day in the 1980’s and early 1990’s was approxi- mately 1000 yuan, providing about 25 yuan per performer. Currently, fees have gone up considerably, with top opera troupes charging sev- eral thousand per day. The minimal wage in the 90’s was 15 yuan ($2USD) paid to a manual laborer to dig ditches or build roads or houses. Such workers are now almost exclusively migrant workers from outside Putian and Fujian. Opera performers could expect 40 to 50 yuan or more a day, making this profession a steady source of income in the area. Official printed posters from the local Bureau of Culture list some sixty authorized opera troupes and warn against hir- ing unregistered troupes (and avoiding the Cultural Ministry tax on opera performances). Other locally produced advertisements point to a thriving business in opera school training and apprenticeships.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Other typical costs include funds for the ritual specialists (usually</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">at least 80 yuan for a single ritual master, but sometimes up to sev- eral hundred yuan for a more elaborate ritual involving several ritual masters). Funds for tea and cigarettes, noodles and food, oil for lamps and incense and spirit money are common features of these posted accounts. The cost of electricity for the broadcasting of the opera (or movies) and the public relations loudspeakers, not to mention the light- ing for temples and floats, is another common item on the accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In their posted annual and specific ritual expenses, temples often note any excess remainder. These funds are shown to have been spent on projects including scholarships for outstanding students in the vil- lage, charity to the destitute, burials for those who could not afford them, the laying of electrical lines in the village and the establishment of some street lights, the laying of roads up to the temples and through parts of the village, the construction of public toilets and other sanita- tion projects, the carrying out of irrigation maintenance (dredging or cleaning out debris from irrigation canals), and other public projects. Occasionally one finds posters announcing very large donations, in the hundreds of thousands of yuan, to disaster relief in another part of China (after floods along the Yangzi river, for example, or the earth- quake in Sichuan).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples, monasteries and processions 213</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">From the range of these expenses, one can see that these temples have become major players in terms of developing local infrastruc- ture. Over the past fifteen to twenty years, local governmental agen- cies have devoted most of their resources to larger scale infrastructure projects—urban  renewal,  major  highways,  new  railways,  large-scale irrigation projects. Funding for these projects comes from provincial and national agencies and from loans from international agencies such as the World Bank. Local funding is raised from taxes (increasingly on factories and businesses, as the agricultural tax has been abandoned) and even more from the appropriation and sale of public resources— since all property belongs to the state and is only leased long-term (usually for seventy years) to the villagers, the local government can impound any building or property deemed necessary for state pur- poses, or build a road or send a railroad through any village it wishes. This has led to all kinds of potential for corruption—expropriation of certain properties rather than others, and sweetheart deals with local developers to take over appropriated village lands. Taxes from business and factories are quickly absorbed upwards into the provin- cial and national coffers, leaving local government scrambling to find funds for salaries for their officials. Thus local governments have little funding for village based projects, and the temple committees have filled an important void in the local political economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Processions</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">Village temples in Putian organize impressive processions of the gods over the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival and on the birthdays of the gods. These processions have been described briefly above. What follows is a series of excerpts from an anonymously written 2002 temple gazetteer, out- lining the procession of Tianshang shengmu (Mazu) at the Lincigong temple (<i>Lingcigong Tianshang shengmu xunyouzhi </i><span class="s8">靈慈</span><span class="s12">宫</span><span class="s8">天上聖母巡游志</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The preface explains that the last great procession of the Heavenly Goddess Mazu took place in 1930, and that now, seventy years later, on the cusp of the millennium, in an age of one country with two political systems in which scientific marvels were being accomplished, and in order to spread Mazu culture and encourage Overseas Chinese from Hong Kong and Macao to return to the homeland, and to aid</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">214 chapter seven</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">world peace and national unification, the temple had divined an aus- picious date and determined that on the eighth, ninth and tenth day of the seventh lunar month of 2000, for three days, they would hold a procession of the Heavenly Mother to bring great good fortune to all. This procession would be the greatest ever—its scale would exceed anything hitherto seen. They planned to have fifty motorcycles lead the way, followed by eighty decorated motorized carts, then 303 ponies, then drum and cymbal troupes and traditional instrumental ensembles, then nine popular performing arts troupes including the tea gathering women, and many other performing arts troupes. In all there would be a total of over 2000 participants in the procession, which would stretch for five Chinese <i>li</i>. This procession would include so many vehicles, horses, fluttering banners dancing in the sky, drums and music shak- ing the firmament, that the people walking along the way would form a never ending stream of bodies. The beauty and majesty of the proces- sion would resound through three townships. This would be the most immense, most spectacular, most solemn and most colorful religious activity in the history of the temple. Throughout the procession was to be protected by the Goddess, who would be escorted by various divine generals, and the organizers of the event who would maintain good order, and would be assisted by the enthusiastic groups who received the Goddess on each of the three evenings, so that the event would run smoothly, bringing peace and harmony to the region.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The remainder of the gazetteer is devoted to outlining 1) the itiner-</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ary of the procession, listing each village and temple visited; 2) the sequence of the procession, with the groups that open the path, the Great Official, the Placard with the Goddess’ greetings, the Placard to Open the Way, the Great Gong, the General Who Opens the Way, the Clear the Way Banners, the Great Banner of the Great Official, the Lanterns of the Great Official, the multiple banners, the divine horses. Next comes the Headsmen representing seven ritual organizations. Then come women sweeping the way, then the palanquin bearing the incense burners, then the Great Official and his horsemen, and the Great Official, followed by a band of musicians with great shawms and gongs. Next come the Eight Attendants, dressed in Qing yamen court runner’s black robes with rattan hats, next comes the Dragon head troupe, followed by the Dragon of linked lanterns, then perform- ing arts troupes, then Female Generals mounted on horseback, then the Goddess’ palanquin, then the Placards of the Sun and the Moon, then Mazu’s Banners, then a nine-tiered umbrella, then the traditional musical ensemble of the temple.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples, monasteries and processions 215</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The gazetteer next itemizes all the things that must be done before the procession, many of which involve set phrases recited while erect- ing a flag pole, or carrying out other ritual actions. Seven Daoist ritual masters are invited to conduct rites, and marionette plays are per- formed. While the Goddess is away from the temple, an altar of the Five Peaks is set up, and a banquet laid for a high official. The Eight Officers of the temple make their shouted salutes morning and night at the temple. For three days a light feast in prepared and for five eve- nings a large feast is consumed. Each day of the procession a group carrying a lantern, a gong, and a clacker patrol the streets and call out the hours. On the second day of the procession nine Daoist ritual masters perform rites in the temple. Oils lamps of destiny are arrayed around the altar.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The subsequent section of the gazetteer itemizes the decoration of</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the temple. Next we find a description of the costumes of the Female General (who wears a hat and carries a sword), the Officers of Yin and Yang (in black and white), the temple committee members in blue robes with black fedoras, the officers of the Central Command in red robes, the Warrant Officers of the Procession in red, the Great Official in gold with red whiskers, the Seal Bearer in purple. Next we find descriptions of the General Who Opens the Way (in martial dress with a great halberd), the Office Staff in court dress, the Wardens and Runners in official dress, the Banner Lad in Song costume, and the Eight Officers (in black robes with red sashes and rattan hats), and the Executioner with his long rod for administering beatings.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Next we find a list of the all the leadership units along the pro- cession and their various functions (secretariat, finance and account- ing, security, general affairs, purchasing, safeguarding, miscellaneous, external liaison, collection of monetary offerings, liaison with the gov- ernment, health and sanitation, and the leaders of each of the village temples that are visited during the procession. Then we find the list of the <i>Fushou </i>(headsmen of Good Fortune) of the procession.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">Finally we find a list of contributions, starting with a gift of 5000 Singapore dollars from the branch Lingcigong Temple in Singapore. Other major nearby temples also make large gifts, including the Long- shangong <span class="s8">龍山宮 </span>Temple (4200 yuan), the Tongjigong (2000 yuan), the Lingyinshê <span class="s8">靈隱社 </span>(2000 yuan), the Xianglong fushê <span class="s8">香龍福社 </span>(2000 yuan), the Xinxian Chenghuangmiao <span class="s8">新縣城隍廟 </span>(500 yuan). Next are listed individual and group contributions, including 1000 yuan from the Temple Committee of the Longshangong Temple, 500 yuan from a shoe factory, 600 yuan from another shoe factory, 560</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">216 chapter seven</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">yuan from another temple, more gifts from other temples, 200 yuan from a noodle factory. Next comes a list of ritual artifacts contributed by individuals, including Mazu’s carved sedan chair (a major gift!), the embroidered banners, hats for the goddess, the Sun and Moon Placards, and other items. Next we find a list of those who have con- tributed additional days of opera performances.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The next section lists the rhymed couplets that were used in the procession, followed by several communications received from the Goddess. The first message outlines the appropriate offerings that each household should prepare to greet the Goddess on her proces- sion: these include fresh flowers, clear tea, fine wine, long life noodles, rich dishes, and offerings of money to the temple. The next two mes- sages offered blessing to all the offerings and people of the region. The final message promised to forgive the transgressions of all the mem- bers of the temple community, and to bring peace and prosperity to all, including Overseas Chinese, students seeking to pass exams, busi- nessmen seeking their fortune, young people seeking a good marriage, people concerned about their health, people with business with gov- ernment officials, people involved in disputes, people who had mar- ried and sought children,—all these and more would see their dreams come true.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">This was followed by the Placard That Opens the Way, outlining the</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">route of the procession. Next follows the text of the shouted salutes of the Eight Officers of the Temple, who are told by their leader that the Goddess is planning to go on procession—they shout out salutes to each of the main officers of the procession and to the <i>Fushou</i>. A group of demon dancers in masks perform a mute dance in which they move the Jinxiangpai <span class="s8">進香牌 </span>(Placard of Advancing and Offering Incense) forward and back before each temple that is visited. The Wardens and Runners are commanded to obey their orders. The Eight Officers con- clude with a series of hoots in response to their leader’s signals. At lunch time, this series of calls and responses is repeated, the Standard Bearer reads out a proclamation, the Village Elders offer incense and bow repeatedly, and a single Daoist ritual master performs a brief rite. The procedures for evening installation of the Goddess at her tempo- rary headquarters in a guest temple are similar. The Goddess is fitted out with a bed, new shoes for her bound feet, tea and refreshments.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The gazetteer goes on to provide some historical information on the temple, which was founded in 1406 as a small shrine, but which was enlarged the following year after making a pilgrimage to the mother</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples, monasteries and processions 217</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">temple on Meizhou Island. The temple was enlarged again in 1568, and another pilgrimage was made to Meizhou. In 1719, the temple fell on hard times, and each of the villages involved with the temple decided to set up their own branch <i>shê </i>temple. Nevertheless, they all considered the Chongfushê <span class="s8">崇福社 </span>temple, which had been built in the Yuan dynasty as their mother <i>shê </i>temple. The Lingcigong <span class="s8">靈慈宮 </span>Temple was finally restored in 1904–1907, and once again a pil- grimage was made to Meizhou to collect incense fire to consecrate the newly restored temple. The temple survived the early years of the PRC government, setting up a school inside but preserving the statue of the Goddess as well. During the campaign to Destroy Feudal Super- stitions, the Goddess twice was kept safe in the homes of villagers. Sadly, there was no escape for the Goddess during the Cultural Revo- lution, when the statue was destroyed. Only a single hall was left of the temple. Finally in 1980, a leader of the Singapore branch temple of the Lingcigong offered to assist in rebuilding the temple, and permis- sion was given in 1982. An elderly Huaqiao <span class="s8">華僑 </span>was sent to Singa- pore to bring back 26,300 Singapore dollars for the rebuilding of the temple, which was completed in 1985. In 1992 further improvements were made, and the work was completed by 1996. in 1997 the temple requested and received official registration from the government. In preparation for the great procession, the temple leaders went to Mei- zhou in 1998 to bring back a golden statue of the Goddess, which was taken on the Great Procession of the year 2000. All of the six ritual territories of the region joined together to ensure the success of this great undertaking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Temples in relation to modernity—relocation and urbanization</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">“Urban renewal” has led to the elimination of almost every trace of traditional architecture in Putian and Hanjiang cities, with the excep- tion of a few temples, monasteries and historic buildings. The new concrete apartment blocks are covered in shiny white tiles. As the boundaries of urban regions like Putian and Hanjiang continue to expand rapidly, surrounding villages are being razed at an alarming rate. Whole villages are flattened to make way for new ring roads and apartment blocks built on speculation. Many villagers complain that their compensation packets are inadequate. Those who refuse to move are ultimately evicted by force. Often villagers are moved into</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">218 chapter seven</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">second rate apartment blocks where their entire way of life is no longer sustainable.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Whether in a new urban setting, or in the villages, the temples pro- vide public spaces for the collective ritual activities of the community. These open squares are used in the villages to dry grain after the har- vest. These public spaces to not add up to a collective (and abstract) public space of civil society such as that described for post-Renais- sance Europe by Jurgen Habermas. They remain resolutely local, even when the scale of the collective ritual takes in many thousands of par- ticipants. In this important sense, they represent a second tier of local government which is not necessarily in opposition to the official local government.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Usually the last buildings left standing in a bulldozed village are the temples. These temples are the focus of long, drawn out negotiations over compensation and new sites for the temples. Local officials appear to respect local conventions to the degree that they are unwilling to offend the local gods- and the entire village population—by unilat- erally tearing down temples. One recently moved and rebuilt tem- ple posted its compensation at 650,000 yuan. In the case of Kuokou<span class="s8">闊口 </span>village to the east of Putian, ancestral home to many of the Chen lineage of the area, all six temples of the village have been moved and built in a row in between banks of apartment buildings. To the north of the city, temples from the Yanshou Weir area have been moved up the mountainside overlooking the Weir and arrayed in a row of eight temples. In the Nanmen southern gate village area which is now the main bus station for Putian, small local <i>shê-miao </i>temples stand in between apartment blocks, close to their original locations. The ritual processions of this neighborhood are still very active, with six differ- ent <i>shê </i>ritual associations organizing troupes of young men to run with palm-leaf sedan chairs around bonfires set in the courtyards of the apartment buildings in front of local neighborhood temples. All six troupes converge in front of the main temple of the region, where they perform and race around six great bonfires to the accompaniment of music and endless firecrackers. This area of the city is amazingly similar to a Taiwanese city neighborhood on the day of the celebration of a local god. Most of Putian City has however lost its neighborhood temples and sense of local community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 132pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LINEAGE AND TERRITORIAL CONNECTIONS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current distribution of surname groups in Putian</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Currently, the distribution of the most common twenty-six of over one hundred surname groups in the villages of the Putian plain is as follows: Chen <span class="s12">陳 </span>are found in 320 villages; Lin <span class="s12">林 </span>240; Huang <span class="s12">黃 </span>184; Zheng <span class="s12">鄭 </span>150; Wu <span class="s12">ª </span>115; Li <span class="s12">李 </span>104; Zhang <span class="s12">張 </span>76; Cai <span class="s12">蔡 </span>61; Liu</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">劉 <span class="p">60; Weng </span>翁 <span class="p">51; Fang </span>方 <span class="p">44; Guo </span>郭 <span class="p">40; Zhu </span>朱 <span class="p">38; Xu </span>許 <span class="p">37:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Wang <span class="s12">王 </span>33; Zhou <span class="s12">周 </span>31; Yao <span class="s12">姚 </span>27; He <span class="s12">何 </span>25; Peng <span class="s12">彭 </span>21; Su <span class="s12">蘇 </span>19;</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Xie <span class="s12">謝 </span>18; Yu <span class="s12">余 </span>14; Cheng <span class="s12">程 </span>14; Kang <span class="s12">康 </span>12; Ou <span class="s12">歐 </span>11; Song <span class="s12">宋 </span>10. The current distribution of several of these lineages is mapped out in <i>Appendix One </i>below.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">These numbers do not discriminate between separate lineages or distinct lines with the same surname, so they only provide a rough measure of the relative size of different surname groups. In some cases, district-wide or pan-prefectural lineage genealogies were drawn up, mostly in the late Qing and even in modern times (this is the case for the Huang and the Zhu). Such efforts to link ever more broadly distrib- uted surname groups into a common lineage requires ever deeper (and less and less likely) historical claims about common shared ancestors linking the various lines of groups with the same surname.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In all these cases, we find an early ancestor, an initial place of settle- ment, often a division into lineage branches, and a distribution of the descendants of different branches in different villages. In some sur- name groups, other lines of descent with the same surname moved into Putian at different times, leading to some confusion. Efforts to link together such disparate lines were a fairly late phenomenon. Note however that many villages were multiple surname villages, with only a minority having full-fledged ancestral halls. Thus many villagers would have lacked such highly elaborated centers for ancestral worship, and would have had to carry out their rites either in older ancestral homes or in their own homes, where the scope of ancestral worship may have been far more limited than in a fully articulated ancestral hall.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Currently, many lineage halls have begun to revive ancestral worship rituals on the Winter Solstice, and support the sweeping of ancestral</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">220 chapter eight</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">graves on the Qingming festival. It is difficult to say whether any lin- eages now carry out a full range of ancestral worship rites such as those described in the <i>Putian Fushan Dongyang Chenshi zupu </i><span class="s12">莆田浮山東洋陳氏族譜 </span>[<i>Lineage Genealogy of the Chen Surname of Fushan in Putian</i>] of Jiaqing 22 (1817). There we read of elaborate rituals per- formed for the ancestors in the ancestral hall and at the many widely scattered gravesites of various ancestors. On the anniversaries of the deaths of the founding ancestors, elaborate and highly formalized rites of offering and sacrifice were carried out in the ancestral hall. Younger lineage members were selected to act as <i>Lisheng </i><span class="s12">禮生 </span>(Masters of Rit- ual) in these rites. Great care was taken to emphasize seniority and hierarchy in the order and scale of offerings, in the formal bows and prostrations made before the ancestor’s spirit tablets, and in the distri- bution of food after the ceremony. The <i>Family Regulations </i>of the Chen lineage  genealogy  mention  that  seven  lineage  members  were  to  be selected each year to act as <i>Fushou </i><span class="s12">福首 </span>(headsmen of good fortune) to carry out offerings to the tutelary god of the nearby Haopushê temple. A fund had been established by the lineage to ensure that these ritual responsibilities would not prove too difficult for any particular <i>Fushou </i>to bear. Lineage representatives were also expected to participate in the Rites of Universal Salvation for the Hungry Ghosts (<i>zhongyuan pudu</i>) that were held each lunar 7/15 at the Buddhist temple in the village which had been built with lineage funds. The founding of the Haopushê <span class="s12">濠浦社 </span>temple of the earth god in Dongyang village during the Ming Jiajing (1522–1566) period is explained in a stone inscrip- tion included in the lineage genealogy. Clearly this was not an official <i>lishê </i>altar established at the beginning of the Ming, but was instead a symbol of the power and influence and ritual independence of the Chen of Dongyang. The <i>Family Regulations </i>also include a provision calling for one of the <i>Fushou </i>to pay an annual visit to a <i>shê </i>temple in Putian city which had branched off from the Haopushê, in order to collect a contribution acknowledging the primacy of the Dongyang founding <i>shê </i>temple.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">While many historical connections between lineage and <i>shê </i>temples and Buddhist monasteries can be seen in the case of the Dongyang Chen lineage, the contemporary example of the Huang lineage of Shit- ing may be used to examine more recent interconnections between lineage and territorially based god cult worship in the Putian plains. During a <i>Yuanxiao </i>ritual held in the semi-repaired ancestral hall of the Huang in Huangxiang in the late 1990s, representatives from each</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and territorial connections 221</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">family came to the hall to worship in turn, and were then presented with lanterns and offerings which they took to their homes. These rituals were presided over by lineage elders. However, a Daoist ritual master had also been invited to escort the gods of the village temple to each household in turn, and the god’s statue was later set up inside the ancestral hall, where it remained throughout the individual fam- ily worshipping and the distribution of lanterns. The god was none other than Huang Miaoying <span class="s12">黃妙應</span>, the Buddhist saint and ancestor of the Huang lineage from the Tang dynasty, worshipped at the nearby Guohuan Chan Buddhist monastery.<span class="s9">1 </span>This mix of ritual traditions resembles the situation described in the Nantai suburbs of Fuzhou by Szonyi (2002).

The point of the case study is to see how lin- eage branches, which once lived in separate neighborhoods, now have scattered across the Shiting area.

Prime Minister Cai Xiang <span class="s12">蔡 襄 </span>repaired the irrigation system, but in his day most water for irrigation was drawn from two large reservoirs. In 1145 the Putian District Magistrate Wang Kanggong <span class="s12">王 康 功 </span>expanded the irri- gation system to irrigate 20,000 <i>mu </i>(over 3000 acres). This made it possible to reclaim further land from the sea, flush the salt from the fields, and convert them into paddy fields. New villages spread into these reclaimed lands. In 1442 the Putian Prefect Liu Pin <span class="s12">劉 玭 </span>agreed to the request of Huang Da Sanxiu <span class="s12">黃 大 三 秀 </span>of Shiting, and again greatly expanded the irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Legend has it that in the Ming Chenghua period (1465–1487), the Chief Minister of the Court for Imperial Sacrifices <span class="s12">太常寺卿 </span>Huang Benqing <span class="s12">黃本清</span>, also from Shiting, took on the repairs to the irriga- tion system, but miscalculated the number of stone slabs needed for the project by over 9000 pieces of stone. He requested that the left- over slabs be laid into a road reaching from Jiangkou to the center of Shiting. The road stretched for Nine <i>Li</i>, giving the plain its name (Jiuliyang—Nine <i>li </i>plain). This road became an important thorough- fare uniting the plain, and it was also the postal road, and included pagodas for welcoming and seeing off official guests.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Shiting is located between the upper and the central main channel of the Nanan Weir (Jiuliyang) irrigation system <span class="s12">南 安 陂 上 沟 和 中 沟 </span>. This area was part of the Yongfengli <span class="s12">永 豐 里 </span>sub-canton. Shiting is an nowadays an elongated super-village combining several formerly separate villages into one continuous settlement, which is currently managed by both the Shidong <span class="s12">石 黃 </span>and the Shixi <span class="s12">石 西 </span>Administrative Villages. The current population is over 10,000 people, but its popula- tion of Overseas Chinese living abroad is over 20,000. The vast major- ity of the people are of the Huang <span class="s12">黃 </span>surname group.

At this time the lineage first became large. In the eighth generation, one Songjuzhe: <span class="s12">松居者 </span>“built a shrine to the ancestors . . . and donated lands for the sacrificial rituals.” Clearly at that time a relatively large lineage organization had developed. The descendants of the Gongmo branch were the most numerous, while the line of Gongzhuo has died out. The Gongmo branch has further divided into the Wenlian <span class="s12">文廉 </span>and Wenchang <span class="s12">文常 </span>branches, so that there are still four major branches of the Huang lineage in Shiting. Currently, Shiting village is divided into four ritual territories, the Damenjia (1) <span class="s12">大門甲</span>, (2) Zhong- huajia <span class="s12">中華甲</span>, (3) Houcuojia <span class="s12">後厝甲</span>, and (4) Houtingjia <span class="s12">後亭甲</span>. The Huang lineage ancestral hall had collapsed but was rebuilt in 1987. Lineage rituals have been revived. However, the Huang ancestral hall is jointly managed by the Shiting Temple management committee. The organization of its lineage ritual is paralleled by the organization of its temple rituals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l8"><li><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Damenjia <span class="s12">大門甲 </span>includes Sanzhangcuo <span class="s12">三張厝</span>, Zhongyangcuo<span class="s12">中央厝</span>, Qiaotouwai <span class="s12">橋頭外</span>, Tianzhongyang <span class="s12">田中央</span>, Dingxipo <span class="s12">頂西坡</span>, Xiaxipo <span class="s12">下西坡</span>, Bangui <span class="s12">半圭</span>, and Houcheng <span class="s12">後埕 </span>villages.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Zhonghuajia <span class="s12">中華甲 </span>includes Dingjiucuo <span class="s12">顶舊厝</span>, Xiajiucuo <span class="s12">下舊厝</span>, Wudunyang <span class="s12">ª墩洋</span>, Xiaogouwei <span class="s12">小沟尾</span>, and Qigancuo <span class="s12">旗杆厝 </span>villages.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Houcuojia <span class="s12">後厝甲 </span>includes Zhaili <span class="s12">寨里 </span>and Yuanyangcuo <span class="s12">鸳鸯厝</span></p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">villages.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Houtingjia <span class="s12">後亭甲 </span>includes Houting <span class="s12">後亭 </span>and Tiezao <span class="s12">铁灶 </span>villages.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The four <i>Jia </i>were originally the four major branches of the Huang lineage, all living in separate regions. The Damenjia <span class="s12">大門甲 </span>is also called the Qiansuofang <span class="s12">前所房</span>, and is made up of the descendants of the Gongqi branch. The Houcuojia <span class="s12">後厝甲 </span>is also called the Zhongjian<span class="s12">中間房 </span>Branch, and are the descendants of the Gonglie branch. The Houtingjia <span class="s12">後亭甲 </span>is also called the Gongsuo fang <span class="s12">公所房</span>, and are the descendants of the Gongmo branch. The Zhonghuajia <span class="s12">中華甲 </span>is also called the Sijianfang <span class="s12">四澗房</span>, and originally consists of the line of the Gongmo branch with the most descendants. However, after the Gong- zhuo branch died out, they were sent to replace this branch. Nowadays</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and territorial connections 225</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">however, the descendants of these different lineage branches no longer live in their original neighborhoods. Instead they all live mixed in with each other. Note in the <i>Map 40: The Four Jia Subdivision of Shiting Vil- lage</i>, that Damenjia (1) is divided into two separate areas, as is Hout- ingjia (4). Both of these <i>Jia </i>lineage branches are now broken up and dispersed into two distinct locations within the greater Shiting area.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The dispersal of lineage branches into different neighborhoods is even more extensive than the sub-division of one or two <i>Jia </i>into sepa- rate territories would suggest. According to the contribution sheets posted during the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival of 1992, there were 1992 males who belong to the Damenjia, of whom 122 lived in Zhongyangcuo<span class="s12">中央厝</span>, 632 in Qiaotouwai <span class="s12">橋頭外</span>, 98 in Tianxia <span class="s12">田下</span>, and 326 in Sanzhangcuo <span class="s12">三張厝</span>, with another 205 living in villages of Houcuojia, including Houcuo <span class="s12">後厝 </span>and 202 more in Yuanyangcuo <span class="s12">鴛鴦厝 </span>(also in Houcuojia). Thus over one fifth of the males of the Damenjia lin- eage branch lived outside their original territorial boundaries, inside the region of another <i>Jia </i>lineage branch.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, several smaller subsections of the various resi- dential neighborhoods are in fact completely made up of subdivisions of one or another branch of the lineage. Thus a single <i>Jia </i>(ritual terri- tory) might be divided into several different lineage branch residential clusters. The maps in the <i>Huang lineage genealogy </i>and the <i>Map of the distribution of settlements in each Jia </i>hanging in the Huang Ancestral Hall reveal some of these intricate inter-relationships, and suggest that lineage organization continues to underlie the temple ritual order in Shiting village.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Shitinggong <span class="s12">石庭宫 </span>and its Fuxingshê <span class="s12">福興社</span>, located in Shixi<span class="s12">石西 </span>village Xiajiucuo <span class="s12">下舊厝</span>, is the overall main temple of the four <i>jia </i><span class="s12">甲 </span>of Shiting. The main gods worshipped are Sandian zhenjun <span class="s12">三殿真君</span>, Zunzhu mingwang <span class="s12">尊主明王 </span>and Houtu furen <span class="s12">后土夫人</span>. The secondary gods are Fazhu xianfei <span class="s12">法主仙妃</span>, Haotian dizi <span class="s12">昊天帝子</span>, Liugong shenghou <span class="s12">柳公聖侯</span>, Jingong shenghou <span class="s12">金公聖侯</span>, Huiji shenghou <span class="s12">惠濟聖侯</span>, Baiya jiangjun <span class="s12">白牙將軍</span>, Gongying tongzi <span class="s12">供應童子 </span>and Fenghuo erlang <span class="s12">風火二郎</span>. The Shitinggong has a Tem- ple Management Committee and an Overseas Chinese Development Committee. This temple has a <i>Tanban </i>(spirit medium altar associa- tion) with a membership of over fifty people, and it has held many <i>guanjie </i>spirit medium training sessions.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Each year during the <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival each <i>Jia </i>in rotation invites the temple incense burners to <i>xingdao </i><span class="s12">行道 </span>(visit each household to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">226 chapter eight</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">carry forth the Dao). On lunar 6/1, the four <i>Jia </i>come together to cel- ebrate the birthday of Sandian zhenjun <span class="s12">三殿真君 </span>and Baiya jiangjun<span class="s12">白牙將軍</span>. The birthdays of the other god are celebrated separately within each <i>Jia </i>neighborhood. For example, the birthday on lunar 3/9 of Huiji shenghou is celebrated by the Houtingjia <span class="s12">後亭甲</span>, while the birthday of Haotian dizi on lunar 8/23 is celebrated by the Zhonghuajia<span class="s12">中華甲</span>. The birthday of Fazhu xianfei is celebrated on lunar 8/21 by the Damenjia <span class="s12">大門甲</span>, and the birthday of Jin Shenghou is celebrated by the Houcuojia <span class="s12">後厝甲 </span>on lunar 10/11. Thus each of these different neighborhoods (of mixed lineage branches) worships different gods within the main temple, and then invites that particular god back to their own neighborhood. Moreover, each time an intercalary lunar fourth month occurs, the Haotian dizi <span class="s12">昊天帝子 </span>(Tiangong yuanshuai<span class="s12">田公元帥</span>) is taken on a procession to each <i>Jia </i>ritual association.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In recent years certain sub-branches of the Huang lineage have organized new god’s birthday rituals, with the apparent intention of setting up a fifth <i>Jia </i>ritual organization in addition to the original Four <i>Jia</i>. This indicates the potential for transforming a lineage based ritual system into a temple based ritual order. However, these new ritual groups still participate in the ritual activities of the original Four <i>Jia</i>, and still participate in overall rituals according to their original posi- tions within the lineage system. Thus even though there has been a clear trend within Shiting towards the reorganization of the ritual order into a territorial system based in neighborhoods with mixed lineage branches, the development of these trends still operates under constraints imposed by the lineage organization as a whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">While lineage organization still places some limits on the develop- ment of god cults in Shiting, in other villages in the nearby Jiangkou region, the different <i>jia </i>neighborhoods are named after different gods, rather than representing different branches of a particular lineage. In many villages, lineage rituals have been largely abandoned, if they existed in the first place, and the principal mode of local social orga- nization is the cult of the gods (for further discussion of the trend towards the territorialization of cults in this area, see Dean 1998).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Of course, there are many other neighborhood temples in the dozen villages that have merged into the greater Shiting village, further com- plicating the question of the interaction between lineage and territorial cult (see the full description in the Survey volume). Moreover, in addi- tion to territorial temples and lineage branch rituals, there are many voluntary ritual groups within the Shiting area. Most of the temples</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and territorial connections 227</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">in Shiting have organized <i>Tanban </i>Altar Associations of spirit medi- ums, who undergo <i>guanjie </i>training sessions. Each of the gods of the temple has a spirit medium whom the deity can possess during ritu- als. As these roles are lifelong, in the past a new set of mediums was trained every second generation, with the elder generation of mediums passing down the techniques of trance, collective dance steps, incanta- tions and chants, and spirit writing. In addition to participating in the rituals of the village temples, the <i>tanban </i>Altar Association often has its own temples, known as Dong <span class="s12">洞 </span>Caverns or Dian <span class="s12">殿 </span>Palaces. In Shiting village the main <i>tanban </i>temple is the Jiulidong <span class="s12">九 鯉 洞 </span>. Other such temples in the area are the Wenyuandian <span class="s12">文 元 殿 </span>of Jiucuo <span class="s12">舊 厝 </span>(located just behind the Jiulidong temple), the Mingandian <span class="s12">明 安 殿 </span>of Jiucen <span class="s12">舊 岑 </span>, and the Rimingtan <span class="s12">日 明 壇 </span>of Yuanyangcuo <span class="s12">鴛 鴦 厝 </span>. Each of these groups worships different sets of deities, and have divided on this basis into Lushanjiao <span class="s12">廬 山 教 </span>, Qiongyaojiao <span class="s12">瓊 瑶 教 </span>, Jinlunjiao <span class="s12">金 輪 教 </span>, and other sects. As will be seen in the next section, networks of temples have branched out of Shiting across Southeast Asia. Here again the links between lineage and temple networks are complex.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Several Three in One temples are also active in the Shiting region, including the Zhiyuantang <span class="s12">志 元 堂 </span>of Shanglin <span class="s12">上 林 </span>, with over 100 initiates, the Fuxingtang <span class="s12">福 興 堂 </span>of Sanzhangcuo <span class="s12">三 張 厝 </span>, and the Yumingtang <span class="s12">玉 明 堂 </span>of Qiaotouwai <span class="s12">橋 頭 外 </span>. These temples worship Lin Zhao’en, founder of the Three in One, and many of his disciples, as well as other popular deities. Their rituals are quite complex. These groups have also spread to Southeast Asia, as can be seen in a recently carved 50 foot long stone inscription at the Zhiyuantang Temple in Shanglin village within Shiting, translated in <i>Appendix 2 </i>below.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This case study reveals the complex interconnections of lineage and neighborhood temples, and voluntary ritual traditions and their tem- ples within one large village on the Putian plains.

These phenomena provide an alternative perspective on the sources of local cultural and ritual change in China. The vital importance of Southeast Asian trade networks for the local cultures and economies of Fujian for centuries has been confirmed by many historical studies (Clark 1991, 2007; So 2000, Vermeer 1990, Ng 1983, Lombard and Aubin 2000). Historians of Overseas Chinese have also long remarked on the importance of native-place associations and chambers of commerce in the evolution of Chinese dominated mercantile networks across Southeast Asia (Purcell 1966; Wang 1991, 2000; Lim and Gosling 1988; Reid 1993, 1996; Cheriot and Reid 1997). Considerable attention has been paid to secret societies and self-protection associations that developed amongst the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia (Ownby and Heidhues 1993; Ownby 1996; ter Haar 1998; Yuan 2000). Less attention has been focused on the key role in the development of these communities of communal Chinese temples and ritual events, or of extended and mutating lineage organizations linked to certain temples which spread across several nations (but see the work of Lombard and Salmon 1980, and Franke, et al., 1980–97).</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Recent scholarship has highlighted the central role of Chinese spirit</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">mediums within Chinese community temples and ritual events in negotiating the forces of modernity in Penang, Malaysia (DeBernardi 2004; 2006; see also earlier work on Chinese spirit mediums in South- east Asia by Elliott 1966, Cheu 1988, and Heinze 1997; for a historical perspective on Chinese spirit possession consult Davis 2001). The best of this kind of research carries forward a line of inquiry centered on the performative aspect of spirit possession in its confrontation with the pressures of social class, ethnic difference, and the forces of capital- ism (Lewis 1971; Sahlins 1988, Tambiah 1970, Kapferer 1983; Weller</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">1994; Morris 2000).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">230 chapter nine</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Open and Closed Chinese villages  revisited</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Skinner (1964–65) sought to break out of the image of the Chinese village as utterly isolated, which was common in village studies in the 60s, by suggesting a continuum of relations to the outside world. One can, however, question whether his model of the village as being open or closed based on political factors such as the cyclical dynastic dynamics, or his other model of the village as an element in a region- ally delimited central-place marketing hierarchy worked by macrore- gional economic flows,—whether either of these models fully describes the <i>transnational villages </i>of the Putian plains (Levitt 2001). To put the question another way, the variables of Skinner’s open model would have to be expanded to include the impact of transnational flows of people,  ideas,  capital,  and  cultural  innovation  and  exchange.  Simi- larly, his diagrams of the local networks of Thai Chinese elites (Skin- ner 1957, 1958) would have to be expanded to include their multiple links back to specific villages in the Chaozhou region of China. This is not to question Skinner’s achievements, but to point out the limits of the period in which he conducted his research in China and South- east Asia. A longer historical perspective can build on the insights and models developed by Skinner to re-position Chinese villages and tem- ples in specific transnational networks that have developed over the past 500 years. Ethnographic research can follow revitalized networks to gain new insights into their forms, structures, and processes, and the spaces they open up for the participants in the networks.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Different networks linking Putian to Southeast Asia are connected</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">through one or more of the following sites or nodes (a node can be a village, a social institution or religious group, or an individual):</p><ol id="l9"><li><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Village affiliation—ties to a nodal “village of origin” in Putian;</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">extended lineage—based in localized lineage nodes in Putian;</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">overseas branch temples of a god cult with its founding temple in Putian; 4) spirit medium ritual traditions emerging from Putian ritual traditions and temples; 5) sectarian movements—temples of the Xing- hua based Three in One movement abroad; 6) Buddhist religious affili- ations: monks with ordination temples or founding temples in Putian or lay followers of such monks and temples; 7) Christian communities led by church leaders from Putian; 8) independent “self-governing vil- lages” of fishermen and smugglers.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Now, with the possible exception of the Christian communities, an individual within any of these nodes could be involved in all the oth-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 231</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ers—a person who was born in a village in Putian might have been raised within one of its lineages, worshipped at one of its temples dedi- cated to a local god, and voluntarily participated in a spirit medium group based in another temple in the village. This person could also have participated in the activities of a third village temple dedicated to the Three in One movement, and also have had some connection with a nearby Buddhist monastery—for example, this person might have been dedicated to Guanyin by his or her parents, offered up as the god’s godchild in return for special protection.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Turning now to Southeast Asia, one finds the following nodes:</p><ol id="l10"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Tongxianghui <span class="s12">同 鄉 會 </span><span class="p">(there are four different Xinghua tongxian- ghui in Singapore, and over 20 around Malaysia).

Brewster appointed Pastor Cheng Bingzhong to lead the community to Sibu, and they still have an active role in the church and the community there.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Returning to our imaginary Putian villager mentioned above as a par- ticipant in many overlapping religious spheres in Putian—should this person then immigrate to (or sojourn in) Southeast Asia, they might very well participate in various Xinghua huiguan activities, activities of their extended lineage, attend branch temples dedicated to the gods of Putian, as well as take part in activities of the Three in One tem- ples. They could also be involved in supporting Buddhist monks and monasteries in Southeast Asia and through them, back in Fujian. And they could be part of a network of collectively trained spirit mediums such as that found in the branch temples of the Jiulidong of Shiting, Putian.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Xinghua people immigrated rather late to Southeast Asia, beginning at the end of the 19th century. We can distinguish three or four generations for analysis—early sojourners who worked pulling rickshaws and repairing bicycles, and later got involved in selling and repairing automobiles and running public buses. A postwar genera- tion who built upon their control of the transportation industry to rise to wealth and prominence with the phenomenal expansion of the transportation system. A third generation growing up in the postwar period who had less contact with Putian due to political conditions during the Cultural Revolution, and who often lost their command of Puxian dialect. Conditions for these generations changed in the 1980s when it became possible to return to Putian once again. This led to a major re-investment in local temples and ritual events in Putian in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 233</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">early 1980s, led by the remaining first generation survivors and second generation leaders. In the 1990’s a return flow of ritual specialists and cultural performers was invited to Southeast Asia by these community leaders. At this time, a group of the Southeast Asian Overseas Chinese leaders, who had been trained as children to be spirit mediums or altar assistants to spirit mediums, began to return to Putian not only to subsidize, but also to participate in the collective training of local spirit mediums in the newly rebuilt temples. This was necessary because of the fact that so many young boys trained as spirit mediums left their villages for the factories of Xiamen or Fuzhou as soon as they reached maturity. Thus it became necessary to speed up the cycle of training, which had formerly taken place once in a generation. In recent years, the collective training of spirit mediums in Putian (<i>guanjie</i>) has taken place every four or five years. While this was partly to make up for the loss of these trainings since 1949—since three sessions of over a week each are required before the boys can become temporarily earth- bound immortals—the entire transnational network soon discovered that the forces of modernization were even more powerful at pulling the teams of spirit mediums apart. The only solution was to hold even more training sessions, every few years. Such an intensification of the cycles of training in ritual methods has had a powerful effect on the transnational network as a whole. Another consequence has been the rapid spread of knowledge and pride in these traditions amongst the young people of the villages of the Jiuliyang irrigation system in the northeast Putian plain.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Kuah (2000) focused on the role of Singapore Chinese lineage mem-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">bers of villages in Penglai county in Anxi, Fujian in rebuilding ances- tral halls in this region. She noted that main lineage rites of the Ke lineage she studied were inscribed within the larger local procession in honor of Qingshui zushi, a procession I had described in its highly conflicted early revival in the mid-1980s (Dean 1993). She suggested that the very notion of lineage has to be expanded into a broader cul- tural network. Her account brings out the mutual roles of the local and overseas members of the network, but her overall focus is on the flow of people and funds from Singapore to Anxi. What is significant about the current intensification of the flows within the Xinghua network is the degree of two-way exchange, especially in the ritual realm.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">234 chapter nine</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Theoretical approaches to transnational  networks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">A recent overview of research on transnational networks (Barnes and Reilly  2007)  introduces  “specific  combinations  of  nodes,  flows  and linkages, which can also be conceived in terms of structures, processes and/or spaces”. Cultural approaches to understanding transnational spaces tend to talk about them in terms of “imaginaries”. For some transnationalism is a cultural realm in which global capital has created practices and meanings and identities that are no longer bound to a specific geographic place. However, these types of spatial approaches have been critiqued for ignoring the material realities that tether these spaces to the ground. Some “insist that transnational spaces are social spaces that rest on infrastructure including communications networks linked to nodes grounded in localities. Therefore, transnational net- works are not detached from the material realities of local spaces, but rather interact with and transform these realities by re-combining the local, national and global in new ways.” Barnes and Reilly (2007) point out that Lefebvre (1991) and Soja (1989) distinguish between “<i>spatial practice </i>(the material organization of space), <i>representation of space </i>(how space is conceptualized, socially constructed and politically con- tested) and <i>spaces of representation </i>(the intersubjective relationship between human agency, and real and conceptual social spaces).”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">By adding network concepts to this model, Barnes and Reilly (2007) suggest one can “examine the <i>processes </i>that create network boundar- ies within transnational spaces. For example, one can describe all of the elements of the network (the network’s spatial practice); exam- ine how the processes occurring within the network and between it and the outside world result in particular representations of that net- work space; and finally, situate the network as a particular type of space for representing one’s ideas. They suggest that a combined net- work/spatial approach also helps understand whether (and for whom) transnational networks are “translocal”, “transnational”, and/or “extra- territorial” phenomenon. “A combined network/spatial approach allows researchers to consider what participants within a particular network see as significant in the types of boundaries or borders that they are crossing.”</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The re-invention of tradition is highly advanced in coastal South-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">east China, and the funding and fervor and ritual knowledge of the Overseas Chinese spirit mediums has played a key role in this process. Several works in Chinese and Southeast Asian studies have recently</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 235</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">explored various theoretical approaches to transnational networks and to translocal spaces (Ong and Nonini 1997, Oakes and Schein 2006, Wang 2005, Feuchtwang 2004). While Ong and Nonini outline certain features of transnational networks of Huaqiao capitalists, Oakes and Schein are interested in migration and networks within China, espe- cially all such translocal networks that exceed the boundaries of the natural village. They define the translocal broadly as “being identified with more than one place at a time” (Oakes and Schein 2006: 1–35). They further argue that the translocal creates new identities, subjectivi- ties, and networks that link places together. These new mobilities and multiple localities, often involving leaps across scale, include translocal imaginaries, including the imagined community of the nation state. Feuchtwang (2004) in contrast argues that there are still many specific processes of place-making underway across China, particularly in the area of local territorial cult celebrations, despite the deterritorializing effects of capitalism (and earlier of Maoist nationalism).</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">These commentators all note the effects of the massive migration</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of floating population of workers from the villages to the cities. Some villages in Putian can appear to be empty shells at certain times, with only the elderly and young children left to watch over newly built multi-story homes. Nonetheless, these villages become animated and crowded on the feast days of the gods, as factory workers and success- ful businessmen return from their far-flung networks all over China.<span class="s9">1 </span>Clearly translocal flows are affected by uneven development all across the different regions of China. Oakes and Schein (2006) also empha- size embodiment in relation to the creation of space/place/networked space. Domestic spaces, the preparation and consumption of food, memory and nostalgia, are all experiences deeply rooted in the body (of the Overseas Chinese abroad and returning home, as well as in the village women thinking of her children in Southeast Asia while preparing holiday ritual meals).</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Levitt (2001) provides one way to think about the embodied nature</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of participating in a transnational network through her notion of the “transnational village”, which I have borrowed for the title of this chapter.

These include: 1) actual migration is not required to be a member; 2) the transnational villages emerge and endure partially because of <i>social </i>remittances (which include the ideas, behavior, and social capital that flow from receiving to send- ing communities); 3) the transnational villages create and are created by organizations that themselves come to act across borders (which include political, religious, and social movement organizations); 4) the development of individuals within transnational villages is diverse. (Levitt 2001: 11–12). Levitt describes and analyzes details of transna- tional villagers’ daily life: She points out that members of transnational communities “develop several fluid, sometimes conflicting identities” (202): “How individuals distribute their loyalty and energy between sending and receiving countries depends upon how political, religious, and social life is organized across space” (Levitt 2001: 203). She also discusses a variety of transnational community forms (203). Levitt’s emphasis throughout is on concepts of community and social field rather than on individual activities of transnational entrepreneurs, as tends to be the case in the studies published by Ong and Nonini (1997). In her more recent work, <i>God Has No Passport </i>(2007), Levitt emphasizes the ability of religion to move beyond national borders in creating the spaces of the transnational village. By extending the analy- sis away from charismatic network founders and networkers, or from a quantitative analysis of the monetary remittances or investments flowing back to the village, but instead looking at the entire village community affected by these agents, we can expand our understand- ing of the spaces created by these networks, whether these be spaces of melancholy memory, longing, imaginary identifications, actual com- munication of local cultural knowledge or of innovations in the ritual order (which can flow back and forth as well).</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Ong (1997) has discussed Overseas Chinese capitalist merchants as</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">“flexible citizens” of an “ungrounded empire”, harbingers of an alter- native modernity.

Rather than arguing that these interests represent a restoration of an essentialistic core of Chinese Confucian values aris- ing at the periphery of “Greater China” (Tu 1991), one could instead point to the fact that certain of these networks are characterized by quite specific ritual traditions rooted in localized practices which were never standardized or considered orthodox in China (see Watson 1985).<span class="s9">3 </span>Moreover, these ritual traditions have evolved in separate and distinct cultural contexts and are now once again involved in processes of mutual elaboration, interaction and transformation.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As mentioned in the Historical Overview above, conditions in the Putian area in the late 19th century and early 20th century deteriorated rapidly. The growth in population, and the decline of the irrigation system led to the formation of feuding multi-village alliances. Efforts on the part of local gentry such as Jiang Chunlin <span class="s12">江春霖 </span>to mediate these disputes and to call for a ceasefire, held in the Dongyueguan (Temple of the Eastern Peak) in Jiangkou, were only partially suc- cessful. Conditions worsened in the Republican period, when armies moved through the region, sometimes burning villages in their wake. All these factors led to considerable emigration to Southeast Asia, pri- marily to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A Xinghua Huiguan <span class="s12">興化會館 </span>was established in Singapore in</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">1920. In 1921, some 1,651 Xinghua emigrants were located in Sin- gapore, but by 1931 their numbers had increased to over 30,000.

Some of these temples flourished, and branched off again into temples scattered around Southeast Asia. The earliest of these temples were Tianhou temples linked to Xinghua Huiguan Native Place Associations. The Xinghua community tended to concentrate on the transportation sector, moving from bicycles to cars to public buses to spare parts to large automobile dealerships to, in recent years, control over many of the palm oil plantations and ethanol producing factories in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Transnational Lineages</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">A small number of lineage halls (usually shrines within larger temples) were founded in Southeast Asia by Xinghua emigrants from the villages of Jiuliyang irrigated plain of northeast Putian county.<span class="s9">4 </span>Amongst these emigrants were members of the Huang lineage of Shiting. As men- tioned above, there are 10,000 Huang living in the fourteen villages of the greater Shiting area. But there are over 20,000 Huang claiming direct links to this lineage living in Southeast Asia. The examination of certain branch lineage genealogies reveals that this lineage was a trans-national contractual super-lineage (Zheng 2003) which allowed non-related members to purchase membership. Families within this lineage adopted in unrelated boys who were then sent to Southeast Asia to sink or swim. The lineage pursued multiple strategies of sur- vival and expansion simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Huang lineage in Shiting and in Southeast Asia is an example</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of a transnational lineage (village).

A recent hand-written genealogy of one branch of the Huang lineage provides far more specific information on the concrete processes of emigra- tion within one branch of the lineage. This document lists names of ancestors who moved to Southeast Asia, adopted sons sent overseas, and those successful lineage members who prospered overseas, and returned home to Shiting. Many of the latter went back and forth, bringing more relations with them, and generating an active flow within the network. This genealogy provides a basis for multi-sited ethnography on the extended lineage in Shiting and Southeast Asia.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Ancestral worship is conducted in the shrine to the Huang ances- tors in the back hall of the Dongtiangong.<span class="s9">5 </span>Similar rites are performed at the Wang ancestral shrine at the back of the Zhaohuimiao in Singa- pore. However, the Xinghua community, being late-comers to South- east Asia in comparison to Hokkien, Hakka, Guangdong, and Hainan communities, have not yet developed Common Surname Associations to link the far-flung descendants of a shared surname together. Other modes of tying the Xinghua community together have developed instead, including the spread of <i>guanjie </i>training in collective spirit mediumistic practices. Indeed, even the Tongtiangong temple, which primarily serves the extended Huang lineage community, maintains two side halls for spirit medium temples from the Jiangkou area, the Mingandian and the Jiulidong. The central hall of the temple is devoted to local gods worshipped in the Shiting region. In many respects, the cults of the gods and the spirit medium ritual tradition are the main vehicles for the expression of lineage identity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Nine Carp Cavern Temple Network</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The mediums who founded the worship of the Four Immortals Lu Shi- yuan <span class="s12">士元盧仙長</span>, Wang Chengguang <span class="s12">成光王仙師</span>, Chen Shande <span class="s12">善德陳仙師</span>, and XieYuanhui <span class="s12">元暉謝仙師 </span>were at first active in a struc- ture built in the late 1920’s or early 1930’s adjoining a temple in Shit- ing.

In  a  parallel  but  independent  process,  a  Jiulidong  temple  was erected as a subsection of the Dongtiangong in Seramban, Malaysia in 1951. Other temples linked loosely to the network can be found in Ipoh in Malaysia, and in Brunei as well. All of these temples were cut off from developments in Putian from the 1950’s onwards. Moreover, each of the four main Jiulidong temples (Singapore, Tibing Tinyi, Kisaran and Jakarta) declares itself to be a <i>fenzhen </i><span class="s12">分鎮 </span>(a network of independent temples, rather than a hierarchical grouping of temples). All of them acknowledge the Jiulidong in Shiting to be their founding temple. This temple has been rebuilt or significantly expanded three times since 1980. In the 1990’s, spirit medium temple leaders from this network divined the location of Immortal Lu Shiyuan’s original temple in Pinghai township in the mountains above the Meizhou Island ferry pier, and built a new temple there.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A number of ritual innovations have occurred in these Southeast</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Asian temples over the course of their independent evolutions, each in a unique political and multi-ethnic environment. These innovations include the development, starting in Sumatra in the 1970’s, of a new set of ritual initiations in the cult of the Goddess Ou Xiangu <span class="s12">歐仙姑 </span>and in techniques of spirit writing and ritual dance for women’s groups. These women participate in the collective dances of the spirit mediums and the <i>tanban </i>altar association held at the conclusion of <i>guanjie </i>initiations in the courtyard outside the temple.

Eventually the women there, and later those in the Jakarta temple, developed a series of training sessions and initia- tion rituals with documents and certificates parallel to those of the men in the <i>tanban </i>spirit medium altar associations. However, given the rel- ative scarcity of Daoist ritual masters in Jakarta, Buddhist monks were called in to perform the <i>Yuxiu </i>Preparatory Cultivation rituals, which are a sort of preliminary funeral, in which the debts incurred at birth to the underworld Treasury, as astrologically determined, are erased by the burning of the appropriate quantities of sprit money. Certifi- cates are issued by the Buddhist monks for participation in the Yogic rites of the Three Mysteries, and the Fast of the Medicine King.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Note that Ou Xiangu is said to be a disciple of Xu Zhenren <span class="s12">徐真人</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">in these documents, linking her with other goddesses such as Chen Jinggu <span class="s12">陳靖姑</span>, a prominent deity of the Lushan ritual tradition. In general, the Daoist ritual traditions of the Putian plains can be catego- rized as Zhengyi traditions, but there is clearly a blurring of boundaries in this region of northern Putian, where the legends and ritual tradi- tions associated with Chen Jinggu are still very powerful.

Still, Putian documents carefully avoid the usual graph for Lushan, and local Daoist ordination certificates stress the connection with the Celestial Masters on Longhushan <span class="s12">龍 虎 山 </span>in Jiangxi (Dean 1993).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Overseas Chinese temple leaders who returned to Shiting in the early 1980’s were wealthy businessmen who had been trained as spirit mediums in their own temples in Southeast Asia. They helped sponsor the rebuilding of temples and the training of a new genera- tion of spirit mediums. They brought back training manuals and ritual paraphernalia. They soon discovered that the pace of economic hyper- development had unusual consequences for their efforts to revive the tradition of the <i>tanban </i>spirit medium altar associations. As soon as the young boys reached adult age they would head off to cities in Fujian, or around China, or later to Southeast Asia or to North and South American and Europe. It became necessary to hold training sessions (normally arranged in a sequence of three <i>guanjie </i>rituals plus one <i>yuxiu </i>(preparatory cultivation for immortality) rite) every five or six years. Thus in some temples, multiple trainings have been held over the past twenty-five years. This has meant a greater role for the Over- seas Chinese temple leaders, be they businessmen, spirit mediums, or both. Many of them now make repeated visits to Putian every year to sponsor and preside over and sometimes to participate in training sessions. More and more local people from Putian pay return visits to the temples in Southeast Asia. The network has become extremely active. These Overseas Chinese spirit mediums/businessmen have suc- cessfully re-established transnational ritual ties between communities that were cut off for over a generation. Now these global citizens/spirit mediums are once again playing an important role in the re-invention of local cultural and religious traditions in Southeast China. All of this entails quite substantial funding of the ritual economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">By ritual economy, we mean more than flow of funds for temple con-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">struction and rituals from Southeast Asia, or the income and expenses of the temples and ritual events within the network (Yang 2000).<span class="s9">8 </span>The</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_142.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">8 <span class="s7">Yang discusses these practices as instances of ritual excess (Bataille), but does not link them adequately to material practices.

Flows of capital are only part of the equation, as the flows of affect and symbolic capital back and forth within the mutually resonating network open up new avenues for the production of value. Indeed, the overwhelming major- ity of the funding of ritual events inside China is now local. This is not to deny that key contributions of capital and ritual knowledge by Overseas Chinese played a decisive role in the recent evolution of this trans-national network.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">What demands attention is the ability of ritual events within these networks to absorb flows of capital or ethnic nationalism without los- ing the power to generate meaningful worlds for participants (Dean and Lamarre 2005; 2008). This issue can be examined in terms of the effects of an expanding ritual market (see Stark and Finke 2000 for a thesis on the strengthening of belief generated in an increasingly diversified ritual marketplace) both in China and in many parts of Southeast Asia. Further research will need to examine class stratifica- tion and the reassertion of social and gender hierarchy within these rituals, while also exploring innovations in social roles and transfor- mative moments within ritual events (including spirit-possession and the setting in motion of cosmological forces).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The ritual traditions of collective training of spirit mediums have become crucial to the maintenance of the far-flung Huang lineage in Southeast Asia. While many different dialect groups of China have common surname associations in Southeast Asia, few such groups can match the intensity and ritual complexity of the <i>Tanban Guanjie </i>per- formances of the Huang emigrants from Putian. In recent years, many other Xinghua temples have imitated the success of this highly effective mode of generating bonds within an immigrant community, even if they did not have such traditions in their home villages in Putian. The combination of local god cults, lineage ties and spirit medium ritual traditions generates a more active, involved, performative and energetic network. On the one hand, leadership within Overseas Chinese com- munities is closely tied to wealth and personal connections. The ability of these businessmen to send remittances back to their home villages has in a few cases led to their becoming the puppet masters of local village life, breeding a culture of dependency. On the other hand, spirit mediumism appears to partially flatten network hierarchies, and open up leadership to horizontal, more open processes. Moreover, local</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">244 chapter nine</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ritual centers still have privileged access to cosmological powers, which can be claimed through ritual performances, and affect the flow of authority within the network.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Members of the Xinghua Southeast Asian networks have returned often to multiple points in Putian, including the Jiulidong in Shiting, as well as to major local sites of the <i>Tanban </i>traditions such as the Mingandian and the Zhiyuantang (see below). Currently, some of the leaders of different Nine Carp Cavern Temple in Indonesia are threat- ening to overpower the prerogatives of the leadership of the Huang lineage within Shiting village itself, as competing factions of very wealthy Overseas Chinese businessmen, who were all trained as spirit mediums in their youth, struggle to determine the shape of the home temples of the cult (the Jiulidong has been rebuilt three times in the past two decades) and of the village (vigorous debates over plans to rebuild the Shitinggong Temple are ongoing).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 160pt;text-indent: -76pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;">Three in One networks interlaced with <span class="p">Tanban </span>Spirit Medium networks</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Three in One religious movement founded by Lin Zhao-en (1517–1598) in the late Ming began as a translocal ritual system with universalist tendencies, and expanded at the end of the 19th century into a transnational network (Dean 1998). By the late Qing, several hundred temples had been founded across Putian and Xianyou. These numbers <i>doubled </i>to over 1000 temples during the Republican period. Currently, Three in One leaders claim that over 500,000 people in the Xinghua area are Three in One initiates. This is out of a total popu- lation of three million, or one out of every six people. The Three in One temples can be found in one out of three villages in Putian. They usually represent an additional, voluntary level of ritual participation and self-cultivation (moral as well as inner alchemical), for those indi- viduals and families who sought initiation into the movement. Only very rarely did they become village temples, in which all members of the village community participate. Most Three in One temples would periodically make a pilgrimage ( <i>jinxiang</i>) to the founding temple, the Zongkongtang, on Dongshan hill in the north sector of Putian city, on the date of Lin Zhao-en’s birth (1/16) or to his tomb in Huating township on the anniversary of his death (7/16). Most temples also participated in local groupings of temples, with ritualized return visits</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 245</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of <i>Daoyou </i>(friends of the Way) to special ritual occasions organized by respective temples (complete with invitation cards). The Three in One temples are translocal in that they are spread evenly but converge on certain central points, and because they group regionally (and by sectarian affiliation) beyond the village or ritual alliance level.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The early Xinghua emigrants to Southeast Asia also carried the Three in One to Singapore and Malaysia. Major temples can be found in Penang, Klang, Seremban, Johor, and Singapore (Dean, 1998). Stat- ues of Lin Zhao’en and his Daoist sidekick Zhuo Wanchun appear in larger composite temples in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore as well (Dongyueguan in Medan, Jiulidong in Singapore, Jakarta, Kisiran, and Tebing tingyi. The newly consecrated (in August, 2008) Sanyitang in Seremban, Malaysia is a massive temple costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. The craftsmen involved in the construction were almost all from Putian. A Buddhist icon factory manager in Jiangkou imported wood from Thailand and had it carved into large Buddhas in Shiting for subsequent delivery to Malaysia (in pieces, within containers). Sev- eral teams of Three in One ritual specialists from Putian were invited to the consecration.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Seremban Sanyitang <span class="s12">三 一 堂 </span>has a long history and dedicated</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">initiates. Interestingly, many of these are also collectively trained spirit mediums. We met the son of the temple director of the Sanyitang in Seremban, and he told us that he was frequently possessed by none other than the Sanyi jiaozhu, Master Xiawuni, Lin Longjiang (Lin Zhao-en) himself. The Sanyitang in Seremban has merged the prac- tise of collective spirit medium initiations with the self-cultivation and ritual practices of the Three in One. As we will see, this kind of mix already occurred in the Shiting region of Putian. However, possession by Lin Longjiang is quite unusual in the Putian plains. The combina- tion of spirit medium traditions with Three in One ritual traditions in the more open and experimental space of Malaysia seems to have encouraged an entirely different embodiment of the teachings of the Master.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A stele carved in 2006 at the Zhiyuantang <span class="s12">志元堂 </span>temple in Houwu</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">village (Shidong) within the Shiting mega-village shows the role in the history of the temple of the Three in One initiates and their spread of their networks into Southeast Asia (and the return flow back to Putian from within this network). The inscription also reveals the intricate links between the Three in One and spirit medium Altar Associates possessed by other popular deities worshipped in this temple, and thus</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">246 chapter nine</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">provide a prehistory to the practices of possession by Lin Longjiang in Malaysia. The stele is entitled “A Glorious Past”, and is inscribed on a (10 x 2 meter slab of black marble, mounted on the hall in a side altar at the Zhiyuantang in Shiting, Putian. See the text and translation in <i>Appendix Two</i>).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Several themes in this inscription deserve comment. First, the mixed level of language is fascinating in such a traditional genre of writing/inscription. Popular colloquialisms mix and jar with generic poetic expressions, creating a unique voice. Secondly, the interaction between the Three in One initiates and the <i>Tanban </i>Altar Association is very close and complex. Although the temple is primarily run by the Three in One initiates, several local popular gods are worshipped in the temple, and these gods possess mediums. At some point, col- lective spirit medium training sessions were established, and eventu- ally the leader of the <i>Tanban </i>Altar Association that developed from these training sessions appears to have taken control over the temple. Both groups appear to have co-existed throughout the history of the temple. Return visits from Three in One initiates based at a branch temple in Kuala Lumpur are crucial for the continued development of the temple. In more recent years, other groups of ritual specialists have also been invited into the temple to conduct rites and perform ritual opera.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The first question again is how this mixture of spirit medium tradi-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">tions and the Three in One affects the nature of the network in South- east Asia, and how that impacts in turn on the transnational space of Shiting, Putian. Once again, the spirit medium traditions add intensity and excitement to an already deeply committed community of Three in One practitioners. Not all Three in One traditions have transformed in this way in Malaysia, so we may be witnessing new forms of ritual innovation, perhaps a product of competition and imitation of other, Hokkien dialect spirit medium activities such as the cult of the Nine Emperors. Further research is needed to sort out these influences and to access the potential long term impact of this particular mix on the transnational imaginary of Putian.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Additional networks</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">While this chapter has focused on the extended Huang lineage, the temple network of the Shiting Jiulidong and their spirit mediums, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 247</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">the network of Three in One temples, there are several other networks that can be traced from various points in Putian to Southeast Asia. These include 1) the networks Xinghua Huiguan <span class="s12">興化會館 </span>that has spread across Southeast Asia, often linked, as in the case of the Singa- pore Xinghua Huiguan, with temples dedicated to Tianhou <span class="s12">天后</span>, and frequently linked with offices of the transportation guild dominated by Xinghua emigrants; 2) the network of the Jiangkou Dongyueguan<span class="s12">江口東嶽觀</span>, which has important branch temples in Medan, Sumatra, Kuching, Malaysia, and in other locations in Indonesia; 3) Buddhist networks of several important monasteries including the Guanghuasi<span class="s12">廣化寺 </span>in Putian that sent off monks to establish branch monaster- ies in Southeast Asia. In 1958, the last wave of these monks was dis- patched. Some of these monks were amongst the first representatives of the Overseas Chinese to return to China in 1979 to offer to assist in the rebuilding of the great Buddhist monasteries of Putian. For example, Buddhist Monk Yuanchan returned with 1.5 million yuan to assist in the rebuilding of the Guanghuasi <span class="s12">廣化寺 </span>in 1979; 4) multiple smaller networks of particular lineages or village temples with one or two tem- ples in Southeast Asia. One example is the Wang surname of Houguan village which built the Zhaohuimiao <span class="s12">昭惠廟 </span>in Singapore in 1955 (the god’s statue had already arrived in 1895), and rebuilt the temple in 1996 with an ancestral shrine in the back room—a lengthy stele dated 1996 outlines this history: 5) Christian networks linking the Xinghua community in Sarawak to the Methodist church in Putian founded by the missionary William Brewster. No doubt other networks could be added to this complex, intertwined and overlapping network. The network of businesses linked to the transportation sector in Singapore and southern Malaysia, which was dominated by Xinghua emigrants, would be another series of interconnected nodes to explore.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The networks linking Putian to Southeast Asia have multiple, tangled strands. Some networks have developed empty shell temples in Singapore to serve as meeting places for the members of the net- work when they gather periodically in that city. Some networks work hierarchically by generation of founding temple to secondary branch temple to tertiary temple, etc. Others consist of independent nodes, like the Jiulidong network, which nonetheless communicate between one another and transmit ritual innovations through the network. Individuals usually are members of multiple networks (commercial associations, native place hooligan, village temple network, lineage network, spirit medium <i>tanban </i>altar association member, worshipper</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">248 chapter nine</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">in Tianhou temples, etc.). Other cultural institutions such as theater troupes and marionette troupes help maintain and interconnect these networks. A single Daoist master from Putian now works in Singapore, and he is often invited to Xinghua temples throughout Malaysia. Three in One ritualists from the Zhurongtang in Johor visit the network of Three in One temples around Malaysia and Singapore, helping to link sectors of the Xinghua community together. So too does the flow of ritual specialists, marionettists, and performers from Putian who travel now quite regularly around the Xinghua communities of Southeast Asia.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The study of such intricate, overlapping networks is one way to prevent local history from falling into the trap of endless recupera- tion by national history. In that model, local history can be nothing more than an endless series of minor variations on a theme, with the underlying issue being the process of cultural unification of the locale with the state. A focus on trans-national, even global networks works against the prevalent model of hierarchical encompassment and top- down gentrification of local society by introducing multiple planes of reference, alternative and transversal sources of cultural invention and investment, and the possibility of a local cultural self-definition draw- ing creatively from multiple sources.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This research has implications for the study of the past as well as for an understanding of future trends in East and Southeast Asia. Research into the temple networks linking the many different sub- ethnic communities (Hokkien, Hakka, Cantonese, Hainanese, Xinghua, Yunnanese, etc.) around Southeast Asia with the temples and lineage halls in their ancestral villages within different local cultural regions of China will provide a long-term perspective on an essential but still little studied aspect of the historical development of what Lombard (2007) called “Another ‘Mediterranean’ in Southeast Asia”. This kind of research will help explicate strategies of self-differentiation, con- flict and conflict resolution internal to the histories of coastal Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. The links between these institutions and other, better studied institutions (trade networks, business fami- lies, tax farmers, remittance agents, etc.) will shed light on Chinese cultural practices and modes of participation in emerging or alternate regimes of global or regional capitalism.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">Study of the renewal of these networks and the role of localized ritual</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">traditions in these processes will reveal essential aspects of the process</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 249</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of globalization and its impact on specific locales. This research will raise important questions about the ability of local cultures to negoti- ate the forces of capitalism, ethnic identity and cultural nationalism sweeping through Asia today. Unexpectedly, these local ritual tradi- tions show extraordinary versatility and flexibility in creatively engag- ing with these forces without losing relevance to their participants. This in turn raises broader questions about the impact of modernity on contemporary Asia and the value of theories of alternative moder- nity for the study of these developments. While some theorists have looked to Overseas Chinese business leaders as the standard bearers of alternative modernity, this chapter examines local ritual traditions linking Southeast China to Southeast Asia and the experiences of par- ticipants in collective rites of spirit medium initiation to trace another possible response to the forces of capitalism in East Asia.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Study of the cycling of tradition within transnational ritual net-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">works leads to new understandings of the resources for fluctuating identity formation with multiple layers and thresholds of identity. One can point to three successive systemic changes within the network as a whole (i.e., the mid-Ming rise of the regional ritual alliances, the late Qing rise of <i>tanban </i>spirit medium association networks, and the early and late 20th century growth of trans-national networks of the Huang lineage based Jiulidong (Nine Carp Cavern-temple)), in which the participating individuals and groups can be understood as transforming nodes, rather than as fixed entities. Furthermore, in each of these instances, non-human “actants”, to use a term of Bruno Latour’s (2005), were a part of the broader “actor-network”. These include the water within the irrigation systems of Putian, the deities invented and invoked within this tradition, and the circuits of capital and flows of industry underlying the success of the Xinghua community in South- east Asia. Taking these <i>actants </i>seriously allows us to conceive of sys- tem-wide changes to the networks which effect human and non-human participants alike. Concrete examination of the construction of these networks allows one to build up an understanding of a certain kind of social assemblage, without requiring the invocation of “the social” in the Durkheimian sense. Study of ritual experience also shows how the figure of the organic individual so central to theories of nationalism and certain varieties of sociological network theory can be questioned by focusing on the micro-sociological level of experience within rit- ual events—there, minor acts of the smallest opposition, the slightest</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">250 chapter nine</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">imitations, and the merest adaptations can lead to the emergence of new realms of experience, changes to ritual traditions, and the devel- opment of new arenas for the generation of multiple, partial or pathic identities.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Anderson (1983; 1991) described archaic empires as centers of mag- ical attraction which unlike modern nation-states did not attempt to totalize and individualize simultaneously, but instead assumed porous borders and mutable subjects. Perhaps one can imagine a new polity that would revert to these models, rather than insisting on organic links between independent subject/bodies, ethnicities, languages, and nation-states. Perhaps this is one longer term potential effect of the spread of multi-national corporate capitalism—the gradual dimin- ishing of the prominence of nationalism and the emergence of new modes of imagined, or performative ritual community within wide- spread trans-national networks.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In some ways the networks described above are resolutely local, while building on and transforming within trans-national flows. Thus in another sense they are neither exclusively local nor entirely global and thus somehow temporarily evade re-assimilation into projects of nationalism or cultural essentialism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Earthbound China or fluid coastal  communities?</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Fei Xiaotong famously entitled one of his books <i>Earthbound China </i>(Fei 1949). For coastal Southeast and South China, however, an alter- native history of a far more culturally mixed set of cultures with fluid boundaries has been developed. Both Clark (1991; 2007) and So (2000) have argued for the openness of coastal Quanzhou to trans- national flows of people, ideas, technologies, crops, and capital. They have argued for the impact of these networks on rural communities gathered into hinterlands for coastal trading centers in the Southern Song, if not before. Rawski (1972) documented the impact of Asian and global trading networks on the everyday life of villagers in Fujian in the Ming, and Ng (1983) has shown the continuation of coastal trading even after the official prohibitions in the late Ming. Taiwanese historians have shown the interconnections between lineages, cults, communities, and associations of many kinds on both sides of the Tai- wan Straits throughout the Qing dynasty, and historians of Southeast</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">transnational networks 251</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Asia have documented the spread across the entire region of Hokkien communities from the Ming onwards. Detailed studies of <i>qiaoxiang </i>(Overseas Chinese [transnational] villages) were conducted by Chen Ta in the 1930s (Chen 1943). More recently, Fujian has been at the center of research on newly revitalizing networks of Overseas Chinese emigration, return visiting, and cultural interaction that develop new, expanded, transnational social spaces.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">One of the most intriguing of Skinner’s (1996) ideas about cultural change and creativity were expressed in his essay on Baba, Peranakan and Mestizo cultures of Southeast Asia. As he explained, these were cultures that had developed independently in a foreign, multi-cultural context. This is one of Skinner’s most explicit statements on the pos- sibility of cultural change and continuous self-differentiation. These hybrid cultures did not become more and more like themselves. Instead they continued to transform and adapt to shifting socio-eco- nomic, political and cultural surrounding forces. Sahlins (1989) set the stage for this discussion in his essay on the intersection of distinct cosmologically inflected cultures in the Pacific rim, where he noted the collision of three completely different economic/cultural systems (Chinese tributary system, Polynesian potlatch system, and Western capitalist mercantile trading system). His theory of cultural change requires such shocking encounters to play themselves out over time, with deep structural ramifications for all the parties involved. Sah- lins (1993) went on to suggest that there was a long early history of globalization that could be studied precisely in those regions where these cultural systems were forced to co-exist over time. These places include the many entrepôts in Southeast Asia, from Rangoon, Bang- kok and Phuket to Penang and Melaka, from Singapore to Jakarta to Kuching, and onwards into the eastern archipelagos of Southeast Asia. DeBernardi’s work (2004; 2006) builds on these insights to provide a historical account of conflict and accommodation between cultures (Malay, Indian Muslim, Chinese (of many dialect groups), and Eng- lish) in Penang, tracing the shifting self-understanding of these com- munities throughout the process of these negotiations, over a 150 year period, and including explicitly the impact of nationalism within colo- nial and post-colonial polities on notions and strategies of cultural essentialism. Skinner’s essay had (1996) suggested that the rise of dis- courses of nationalism and ethnic identity spelled the end for hybrid cultures of Southeast Asia. But, DeBernardi (2004; 2006) shows that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">252 chapter nine</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">hybridity continues to play a role at the local level in the interactions between and among ethnic groups in their respective negotiations of modernity.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">These insights into the extraordinary creative impact of (transna- tional) hybrid culture can be extended back to our understandings of the local cultures of Southern and Southeast China. Rather than being faced with a choice between staying put in their village or imagin- ing themselves as one with the imperial order of space (Faure and Siu, 2006), villagers in these transnational villages were simultaneously present in multiple spaces. They were part of an extended, transna- tional social field that reaches beyond the limits of their marketing system, national borders, and imperial imaginaries. These spaces are created through networks sustained by ties of ritual tradition, religious faith and performance, “lineage” stretched to the breaking point, flex- ible associational groupings, shared experiences and narratives, and economic investment in community (education, temples, hospitals, infrastructure) as well as in fields and factories. With the example of Skinner’s temporary zones of cultural independence and experimenta- tion in Southeast Asia in mind, one can rethink the cultural resources and expanding realm of local cultural experimentation open to the (trans-)regional cultures of coastal China.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">None of these models quite fit with well-known models of the flex-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ible citizenship of Chinese capitalists or of the return of the traditional Confucian periphery—or to visions of orthopraxy and cultural unifor- mity within China, for that matter. Watson (2007) notes in a recent rejoinder to questions about his theory of Chinese cultural orthopraxy that if he had done his research in the New Territories now it would not have been on village ritual but on strategies of the transnational lineage—not on processes of cultural homogeneity, uniformity and control but on adaptation and change in conditions of global diasporic distribution. Sangren (1984), commenting on the research of Maurice Freedman and Lawrence Crissman on Chinese communities in South- east Asia, identified the importance of flexible associational strategies of the Overseas Chinese (and by extension, of transnational villagers throughout various transnational networks) in successfully adapting to changing circumstances:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">It is more the experience of creating and participating in groups than the acknowledgement of particularistic ties that accounts for the Chinese tal- ent for organizing so adaptively to diverse environments.

The discussion covers topics such as the nature of space and time in these rituals, the multiple liturgical frameworks at play in a single ritual, and the multiple points of view that co-exist within any such complex ritual event. The complexity of the experience of these ritual events calls for a new approach to issues of subjectivity and agency. This chapter therefore introduces a micro-sociological mode of analysis to examine questions such as ritual change and ritual process in terms other than formations of identity. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the relationship of ritual to modernity, and an overview of the implications of the rise of the “ritual power formation” in the Putian plains for the study of local history in China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Hybrid space, hybrid time</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The ritual events of the Putian plain occur in a hybrid space, which mixes administrative territories of past and present dynasties with the locally-created spaces of the ritual alliances. Daoist documents, printed prayer forms, and local participants in ritual events give their addresses in terms that mix spatial layers of the past imperial system and modern administrative terms with the current spaces of the ritual alliances. People are identified on these documents as “Mr. or Madame X, of Fujian Province, Putian county, X (imperial) sub-canton, X ritual alliance, X village, X temple, and X <i>shê</i>-altar”. Given this mixed space- time continuum of ritual, it comes as no surprise that the space of the temple can be transformed into a Land of the Way by the installation of a portable Daoist altar. During the Daoist rites (and the same pro- cesses apply to Buddhist and Three in One rites) the ritual specialists visualize a transformation of the space of the altar and the temple into a charged cosmic space, stretching in all directions, and filled with the cosmological forces of their respective ritual traditions. For the Daoist</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">256 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">masters these include the astral deities of the Daoist stellar courts, the emblematic animals of the four directions, and the spirit generals and their hosts of spirit soldiers who assist the Daoist ritual master in driving away demonic influences and clearing the way for the cosmic renewal brought about by the recitation of the scriptures of the Way and the inner voyage of the chief ritual master to the Daoist heavens to memorialize on behalf of the community. In one rite of the Dao- ist ritual tradition, the ritual masters run around eight tables marked with the hexagrams of the Book of Changes formed out of piles of rice. In the center is the Yinyang symbol. The rite is a deconstruction of the organized cosmos in a return to the undifferentiated Dao, and a re-commencement of the cosmos. After invoking the powers of each direction, the ritual masters unmake the hexagrams, ending with the merging of Yin and Yang symbols. At this point, the younger ritual masters leap over the tables while waving flags and banners attracting the gods to the spectacle. The conclusion of the Daoist rites involves the sending off a paper messenger mounted on a paper horse, bearing a written memorial. These figures are “transformed by flames” into the ever-present invisible realm of the gods.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In the processions of the gods, the village space is re-energized and</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">purified by the god’s tour of inspection. The god visits each household to “carry out the Dao”, bringing renewed cosmic powers to bear on the health and prosperity of the household members. Spirit mediums pos- sessed by the gods also inhabit a hybrid space—striding between this world and the world of the gods. This being-outside themselves (ex- stasis, ecstasy) enables the mediums to undergo feats of endurance of pain—walking barefoot across glowing coals, standing in the shooting flames of a large Roman Candle bare-chested, or striking themselves with maces until blood runs freely down their backs as they are car- ried in sedan chairs around the village boundaries. The special space of mediumistic trance is traced in the collective dance patterns of the <i>Tanban </i>Altar Associates of the northern irrigated plain, who draw out elaborate cosmological patterns as they run after the mediums in trance.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">At a larger spatial level, the networks of regional alliance are traced</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">by moving lines of god processions and linked lantern processions.

However, we have also seen that each village and each villager can be part of multiple networks, some linked to ecological factors, others more open to the creation of voluntary associations. Initiates of the Three in One movement, and members of lay Buddhist movements, are linked in local networks but also in overall networks, centering on the Zongkongtang and the tomb of Lin Zhao’en. Many god cults, such as those dedicated to Yuhuang dadi, Tianshang shengmu (Mazu), or Tiangong yuanshuai, have similar cult centers and networks formed by pilgrimages and incense division. The fundamental openness of the gods to worship of any kind means that travelers are welcome in vil- lage temples, and new connections are continually being forged. Cen- ters for dream divination are popular places for new encounters with cosmic forces. The spatial system of the gods is profoundly localized and profoundly open at the same time. As mentioned above, the relo- cation of temples under conditions of “urban renewal” has presented new challenges to communal activity, but in several cases (Nanmen near Putian), the rituals of the </span>shê <span class="p">altars of the transformed localities have taken over the new urban spaces fairly successfully.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">If we conclude that the ritual event is characterized by a multiplicity</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">of hybrid spatial realms, we can also see similar effects in terms of the temporality of ritual. The annual rites of welcoming the gods back at New Years and celebrating and protecting the community (<i>yuanxiao</i>), the <i>Pudu </i>(universal deliverance of the hungry ghosts), the autumnal communal rituals of thanksgiving for the harvest, and the send off of the gods at the end of the year provide a continuous cosmological temporal framework. When one adds onto these events annual ritu- als of commemoration for ancestors (on Qingming <span class="s12">清明 </span>or Dongzhi<span class="s12">冬至</span>), the many birthdays of the local gods, and rituals associated with particular religious movements (such as Three in One, lay Buddhist, or local spirit altars), one reaches a point in which ritual activities are taking place in one’s village or in nearby villages two out of every three days. If one adds to this the daily rites of veneration of the ancestors and household gods on family altars, or daily offerings in Three in One temples and Buddhist shrines by initiates, or the random offer- ings of incense and consultation with the gods through divination that take place on a daily basis in temples across the Putian plains, one reaches a point at which it is difficult to distinguish ritual life from the everyday.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">258 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">We suggested above that the collective rituals of the village temples be seen as the intensification of the ritual basis of everyday life, rather than as separate sacred, a-temporal time apart. Membership in the <i>jia </i>household is also primarily a ritual function (Chun 2000). Each individual is simultaneously part of several overlapping ritual regimes (household, lineage, village temples, voluntary associations, linked cults). But note that everyday life is also the realm of leisure, friend- ship, and pleasure (Lefebvre), and that these element also are intensi- fied in the playfulness, rivalries, performative pleasure, humor, tumult and excitement of ritual events.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Ritual temporality is also subject to transformation by the actions of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ritual specialists. Daoist ritual masters reverse time in their visualiza- tions in a return to the undifferentiated Dao beyond the origin of time. They also accelerate cycles of time through the recitation of scriptures that claim to be transmitted once every kalpa (cosmic cycle), thereby generating merit for the community. The tempo of ritual performances is such that clock time disappears and ritual actions take on dreamlike qualities as rituals stretch on in some cases for days with only short breaks between rites. Certain rituals work with cosmological methods to exorcize demons through cracks in time. Spirit possession seems to emerge from such cracks in time, as people suddenly fall into trance and just as suddenly come out of it. Utterances by possessed medi- ums can scramble historical periods through especially intense rela- tions with different eras—one medium we met put the Tang before the Han dynasty, and both times overtook and replaced the present. Ritual action is itself constantly subject to interruption from divination of the gods’ reactions to the rites.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The intensive qualities of the hybrid space-time continuums of rit-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ual events open up worlds of difference for their participants.

The analysis of ritual events in the Putian plains offers a different way to understand the contemporary co-existence and potential co-operation of ritual and capital in contemporary southeast China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The syncretic ritual field and the ritual event</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">From the descriptions of rituals in the Putian plains given above, and from the historical overview of the introduction and adaptation of many different kinds of ritual traditions into Putian over time, one can see that contemporary ritual events are complex collective actions with many different participants in different roles. These ritual events are characterized by multiple and mixed liturgical frameworks, and events unfold in multiple centers of activity. These rituals display competing tendencies towards order and chaos. They seem to be able to evade being captured within any one frame (capitalist, nationalist, even localist), but instead generate multiple frames of reference. Here we will discuss first the historical layers of the syncretic ritual field, then fundamental opposing tendencies within rituals, and then the multiple centers of activity. We will ask what questions these features raise for a theory of ritual.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">From the historical overview above, one can construct a conception</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">of the syncretic field of Chinese ritual practice as having been built up over many centuries through innovations in ritual practice into a multi-layered field of forces (symbolic, cosmic, political, socio-eco- nomic). Each layer or plane of ritual experience was generated by a particular ritual tradition—from spirit possession to Buddhist rites, to Confucian ancestral rites, and Daoist collective rites for regional alli- ances—each of these traditions was the central, most powerful ritual form of a particular era. All these layers or planes were generated by ritual forms that demand specific ranges of bodily experience, require collective labor and resources, and mobilize cosmological forces. Mul- tiple planes/layers of ritual form co-exist in the syncretic field. Any one individual may take part in rituals of many different layers of the field by attending events in a Buddhist monastery, a village temple, a lay Buddhist or Three in One hall, or a regional procession. More importantly for an understanding of the ritual field, however, is that the co-presence of these different layers/planes of ritual forms allows</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">260 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">for the continuous creation of new hybrid ritual forms through the interactions between layers of the field, through processes of infini- tesimal imitation, opposition, and adaptation. Every ritual form bor- rows elements from the others. Individuals are part of many such hybrid forms. One can be a ritual specialist in more than one tradi- tion. Moreover, given the multiple liturgical frameworks found within contemporary rituals in Putian, one finds elements of all the earlier layers actively playing a role in specific events today. Thus each ritual event folds in all the layers of the syncretic field, and unfolds them through its sequence of actions taking place simultaneously in mul- tiple centers.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The syncretic field can also be analyzed in terms of two opposing tendencies, which can be called, drawing on indigenous concepts, <i>Sheng </i><span class="s12">聖 </span>(saintly power of self-cultivation) and <i>Ling </i><span class="s12">靈 </span>(spontane- ous cosmological power). <i>Sheng </i>activities include the careful laying out of a cosmologically oriented altar, visualization of the invited dei- ties, invocation of the deities through swiftly shifting <i>mudras</i>, spells, and commands, courtly ritual actions such as offerings and the prep- aration, recitation, and transmission through burning of memorials and other bureaucratic documents. The <i>Ling </i>pole is evident in spirit possession of mediums, spontaneous transmission of trance states through a crowd, and even in the moment of transformation of some ritual specialists into higher deities (<i>bianshen </i><span class="s12">變 身 </span>). The ritual-field is stretched between these bi-polar attractors. At different moments in the course of their discrete liturgies, ritual specialists may move away from one pole towards the other. Worshippers in the community also are drawn back and forth between more orderly forms of worship and the exuberance and excitement of the event.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The multiplicity and hybrid nature of the liturgical frameworks, together with the multiple centers of action of ritual events make it difficult (and unhelpful) to interpret the ritual from a single perspec- tive (as the embodiment of a particular belief system or value sys- tem, or as the sincere expression of one person’s beliefs). Doubling the underlying framework (mediated relations to cosmological forces vs. unmediated relations with local deities) does not get one much further. One needs an approach to a multitudinous ritual event as experienced from multiple nodes of perception rather than insisting on subjective agency (consciousness) as the only point of departure for an analysis of ritual.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 261</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microsociology of the ritual event</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">A theoretical resource for this analysis can be found in the work of Gabriel Tarde, an early sociological thinker. Tarde emphasizes the laws of imitation, opposition, and adaptation at all levels of society, and his definition of society is very inclusive (it extends to any group- ing of beings or even molecules). More importantly for our purposes, Tarde introduces a micro-sociology into his theory of social laws. He stresses different levels of perceptions, reactions, and actions within each individual (a society of molecules), while also examining each individual as part of a set of larger social groups. The individual in Tarde’s view is made up of many levels of perception/awareness—and different points of view may emerge at different levels within the same individual. Tarde adopts the terminology of Leibniz and describes the individual as composed of monads—different points of view—from self-conscious mind to proprioceptive awareness to layers of mood and affect to pre-conscious sensitivity to unconscious levels of awareness. Each of these different nodes of perception, or monads, have differ- ing appetites and degrees of perception—and each level, from uncon- sciousness to conscious, is the result of different aggregates of monads, with some more dominant than others.<span class="s9">2 </span>In effect, Tarde argues that the individual is multiple, or at least is composed of multiple levels of perception/reaction. Tarde also extends this kind of analysis to group subjectivities (of crowds, armies, monasteries, corporations). Tarde’s microsociological approach provides a fresh way of seeing the simulta- neous emergence of the individual and the social group. The explora- tion of the monadic action-mind as an infinitesimal differentiation of the social realm allows one to look at the social from the angle of the event, attending to how social forces emerge at the micro-level, and how change and innovation happen.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike Durkheim, Tarde does not presuppose the existence of the</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">social (as the ultimate determination of each individual, who achieves his unified identity by absorbing the social) but works instead to analyze the concrete mechanisms whereby specific social groups or</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_145.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">2 <span class="s7">Note that in contrast to Leibniz’ model of closed off monads, Tarde’s monads are nodes of perception or points of view that are open to one another, and continually interact.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">262 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">networks are formed. This aspect of Tarde’s approach is similar to that of recent versions of ANT (actor-network-theory) as advocated by Bruno Latour and others. ANT looks the systemic interaction of all the elements in a network, including non-human elements such as objects, physical processes, natural resources, and ecological features. This approach can be helpful in thinking through the effects of ecolog- ical constraints of the coastal irrigation systems on socio-ritual forma- tions (regional ritual alliances) of the Putian plains. For Tarde, ‘every thing is a society, every phenomenon is a social fact’, even the mind (Tarde 1999: 58). Psychology thus is central to sociology, and social action emerges from the actions of monadic, multi-layered minds. The mind is a social action.<span class="s9">3 </span>There is no separation or opposition between individual human monad and society or collective group. Rather indi- vidual and society emerge together, and what looks like the psychic state of an individual turns out to be an integration/differentiation of small social variations.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Tarde’s laws of imitation, opposition, and adaptation are ontologi-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">cally prior to social hierarchies and imposition of social facts. If one reads the laws of imitation sociologically, at the same level as institu- tions, one completely misses out on molecular movement. Microsoci- ology thus also resonates with Foucault’s microhistories which situated subjective technologies and bodies as ontologically prior to modes of production in order to remap modernity. Imitation, opposition, and adaptation work at all levels and scales, both in broad strokes and in infinitesimal ways. Imitation can work to repeat the same. However, through the most infinitesimal of interferences (opposition) or inven- tions (adaptations), imitation (repetition) can open up difference. Rather than searching for the complete opposite, as in dialectics, Tarde examines the consequences of the smallest forms of opposition, such as acts of hesitation. Rather than looking only at the imitation of great men and great ideas, Tarde discusses cultural invention as the infini- tesimal adaptation of techniques and ideas by many people. Different scales of analysis bring out startling distinct qualities of (ritual) activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_146.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">3 </span>Gilles Deleuze comments ‘it is completely wrong to reduce Tarde’s sociology to a psychologism or even an interpsychology . . . What Tarde inaugurates is a microso- ciology, which is not necessarily concerned with what happens between individuals but with what happens within a single individual . . .’ Crucial to a microsociology that would avoid psychologism is an understanding of the individual as a monad (made up of many monads, or points of view at different levels), much as announced in Tarde’s <i>Monadologie et Sociologie</i>.

In the context of ritual, this means that the mass of participants are seen simply to imitate the innovations of some great innovator. There is however a deeper level of Tarde’s philosophy, at which ‘(imitation) is repetition which serves difference’. This is also the level at which Tarde turns away from ‘impersonal givens or the Ideas of great men’ in favor of ‘the little ideas of little men’. It is then a matter of ‘little inventions and interferences between imitative currents’.<span class="s9">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Microsociology is particularly promising approach for the study of ritual activities in southeast China, because those ritual activities have typically been construed in exceedingly Durkheimian terms—as a site of reproduction of the social, as the site of elimination of difference, in which the articulation of local differences or autonomies always appears tenuous at best. By the very terms of this model, local differ- ence is fated to capitulate to the imperial center, with its presumed Confucian order. In other fields there exist other accounts of ritual activities that stress the spontaneous emergence of practices as well as a thoroughgoing renegotiation of the social order, but the general sociological bias to the study of Northeast Asia is geared largely to the reinscription of immutable national or proto-national identities. This is due to the legacy of modernization theory in the formation of area studies, entrenched and unexamined.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Because microsociology thinks the social from the angle of the</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">event, it foregoes the dubious logic of modernization theory, in which the duality of individual and society is transposed onto that of moder- nity and tradition, thus imposing a situation in which the modern individual struggles against the constraints of traditional society in an attempt to Westernize and modernize, an attempt that is preordained to fail no matter how far modernization advances. But this is not only a problem of area studies. While the refusal to question modernization theory appears most virulent in the context of area studies, it is not unusual for thinkers schooled in the very philosophies of difference that issued a challenge to modernization to replicate it as soon as they step out of the Western enclave.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Tarde’s concepts of imitation, opposition, and adaptation can be applied in broad strokes to the history of ritual forms in the Putian plains. For example, at a very basic, institutional level, one might say</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_147.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4 <span class="s7">Deleuze 1994: 312–13, n. 3.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">264 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">that early lineage groups sought to imitate the ritual actions of the aristocracy. Other surname groups showed their opposition to con- straints within (or their exclusion from) the classical ancestral worship system by expanding the objects of worship beyond the prescribed five generations of ancestors. Finally, these new, expanded ancestral worship rites were broadly adapted through continual modification by more and more emergent lineages across the Putian plains.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: right;">Daoist ritual also clearly imitates court audiences, and Confucian masters of ritual (<i>Yanshi </i>in Putian) assist lineage members and temple worshippers in rites also clearly imitative of court ritual and classical rites. We have seen above that Buddhist monks and Three in One Scripture Masters can also perform rituals that are clearly parallel, or imitative, to those of the Daoist ritual masters. Forces of opposition and adaptation can also be seen in the elaboration of different panthe- ons (cosmological powers) addressed and invoked by these different ritual traditions (opposition), and in the mutual borrowing (adapta- tion) that has characterized the evolution of their respective liturgies. All these examples tend to make ritual out to be the machinery of empire, with the imitation of an orthodox court ritual form spreading across the land, with allowances for minor opposition and local adap- tations. In this view, ritual as imitation is the repetition of the same, and the repeated re-inscription of the individual into the cultural unity of the state. This perspective ties in neatly with work on Chinese cul- tural hegemony and ritual orthopraxy, as it even makes allowances for</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">local interpretations and modifications (variation).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Tarde suggests that there is another, deeper level of the laws of imitation (repetition), opposition (hesitation) and adaptation (inven- tion) which is best explored at the bodily level of individual experi- ence (micro-sociology). What, one might ask, is the possessed sprit medium imitating, in his highly stylized trance movements? When one’s actions become close to involuntary, who is doing the imitating? In any case, Tarde points out that imitation at a more profound level can be understood as a repetition of difference in itself (that which continues to self-differentiate), and thus the opening up of new worlds of experience at the molecular, individual, and group levels. This open- ness of imitation to difference is the “apparent paradox of ritual, which is designed to repeat the unrepeatable.”</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Looking at the development of ritual forms in the Putian plains in this way, one can find in ritual an engine of social change, rather than only a machinery for the imposition of the same (cultural unifi-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 265</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">cation, identification with the state). In this perspective, ritual is also not reduced to a general social glue mediating different state and local institutions, or a pressure valve outlet for social dissent, or a struc- tural originary indetermination that can only be displaced. All these approaches (including the cultural hegemonic approach) make ritual into a conduit for something else, or the means to an end—cultural unification, individual identity, social harmony, rather than something in itself. If one looks at the entire range of experiences involved in a ritual event, one can instead argue that ritual-experience is the collec- tive actualization of (potentially new) worlds, rather than (only) the re-imposition of pre-determined ideas or social relations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Metastability of the gods</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Another extraordinary feature of the rituals of the Putian plains is the sheer number and diversity of gods. These multiple deities constitute a metastable system. Before explaining this conception, it is important to point out the gods are represented differently within the same ritual event by: 1) ritual masters whose texts describe them as avatars of higher astral gods; 2) by temple leaders who see the gods as ambiva- lent protectors of the locale; 3) by possessed mediums who act as the god in the flesh; 4) by village households who see the gods as forces of exorcism, purification and blessing; 5) by individual worshippers who may see the gods as sources of divine support (or punishment) and as potential interlocutors, deities who respond to prayers, offerings, even bribes, and whose response can appear in divination blocks or poems, in spirit writing, in dreams and visions, or in miraculous responses to prayers. What is most significant about all these different representa- tions (there are no doubt others) is the taboo on contradiction—each accepts the other representations without insisting on logical or doc- trinal inconsistencies. Or to put the matter differently, one finds in the multiplicity of representations, mode of invocation, and cosmological powers of the gods the workings of a (collective) positive unconscious, which accepts all these representations/powers as different manifesta- tions of cosmological force.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Not only can there be more than one deity (or more than one repre-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">sentation of the same deity), but also each resident deity is multivalent, embodying and emanating different qualities, which shift over time. It is the inherent multiplicity of deities that allows for temple and ritual</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">266 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">alliances: Among its many qualities, each deity has some aspects that permit connection with the deities in other temples.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The multiplicity of the gods is not an inert multiplicity, a neutral collection of differences. For the deities are metastable. The metastabil- ity of the gods is evidenced in their double personalities and multiple personalities. A physical system is said to be in metastable equilibrium (or false equilibrium) when the least modification serves to break the equilibrium.<span class="s9">5 </span>Any system in a metastable state harbors potentials that are incompatible insofar as they belong to heterogeneous dimensions. This is why systems in a metastable state can only perpetuate them- selves by dephasing, that is, by a change in the state of the system.<span class="s9">6</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Moving the Gods, releasing  forces</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Moving a deity from its perch in a temple is a powerful act, one that potentially alters an entire field of forces. Summoning a deity opens its fundamental asymmetry or instability. In other words, by moving the metastable deities, the ritual event releases the force implicit in their fundamental asymmetry, and then establishes two different yet inter- related relations to that force—<i>sheng </i>and <i>ling</i>—what might be thought of as polar attractors in what is now a field of forces. Within a field of forces, a systems theory model of feedback, regular repetition, pertur- bant flows, and the modulation of forces provides one way of analyz- ing the unfolding of the ritual event.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Moving the gods serves to transform their ‘instability’ into a force</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">(or to dephase their metastability). The carefully prepared and over- coded space of the altar of the ritual master is designed to prevent a chaotic, undirected release of that force. The idea is to harness and guide it. This controlled relation to cosmological forces is what we refer to as <i>sheng</i>, for it evokes self-cultivation, sageliness, and hierar-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_148.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">5 <span class="s7">A prime example is crystallization.

In terms of the practices of ritual masters, <i>sheng </i>implies controlled processes of self-transformation—techniques of visualiza- tion, the recitation of ‘secret’ mantra, performance of <i>mudras</i>, and choreography—all of which lead to identification with a divinity in a stepwise, encoded fashion. However, the ritual master in the <i>sheng </i>mode simultaneously works within hierarchical overcoding and at the same time carefully decodes signs in order to move upward in the hierarchical ladder—until the point that he reaches the divinity itself. At the other extreme is what we have called <i>ling</i>, which is best exemplified in spirit possession—which involves trance, loss of self, spontaneous and uncontrolled bodily movements, and speaking in the voices of gods. Ling finds pure repetition across <i>sheng</i>’s hierarchical distinctions, in order to stage improbable, unlikely, magical connec- tions between different times and spaces (phases) of sagely ascent. It decodes and deterritorializes coded objects and states, but most impor- tantly, <i>ling </i>dephases. It treats <i>sheng </i>hierarchies as a metastable state in their excess of order and symmetry. In dephasing, symmetry is at once broken and retained. <i>Ling </i>thus calls on the deity’s eccentricity as a non-localizable force. Trance, for instance, makes the first step and the top of the ladder indistinguishable—it is an automatic identifica- tion with the gods, which comes with automatism, that is, tics and</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">twitches and babble.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Thus the relation between <i>sheng </i>and <i>ling </i>is, in some way, a non-rela- tion. <i>Ling </i>is always undermining the coded relations of <i>sheng </i>yet has no purchase without them. <i>Sheng </i>continually brings <i>ling </i>into relation, but in fact, cannot relate anything without it. Their relation then is non-dialectical, and yet the co-existence of these two different modes of relation to the gods leads to the emergence of something new.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: -100pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;">Moving the gods—containing forces through hesitation, integration, and paired opposition</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">To return to the moment of the moving of the gods from the temple at the start of the procession, one notes that the sedan chair moves back and forth several times before heading off on the procession. A similar pattern is repeated upon the return of the god’s palanquin at the end of the procession. What is the significance of this hesitation? As discussed above, the deity’s mind acts in more than one place at the same time. Deities are poised between earth and some other celestial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">268 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">realm. Thus the hesitation of the deity to come forth from the temple, all the efforts to cajole and usher it out, can be understood in terms of infinitesimal social opposition. The deity, its action-mind, integrates the small variations of opposition in the social order—across villages, within a village, between village and cosmos.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">How is this integration achieved? Despite the potential in its mul- tiple personality for infinite connections within and among villages, the deity tends to settle into opposed pairs of traits (small yet big, earthly yet divine, benevolent yet malign—or at another level, us ver- sus them). In this way, the deity can be said to deploy opposition to form a limited whole which polarizes and standardizes difference, but which guarantees that difference is in the service of repetition of the same. Taking as an example of the division of the sexes in evolution, Deleuze writes:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Opposition . . . is only the figure by means of which a difference is dis- tributed throughout repetition in order to limit it and to open up a new order or a new infinity: for example, when the parts of life are opposed in pairs, it renounces any indefinite growth or multiplication in order to form limited wholes. Nevertheless, life thereby attains an infinity of another kind, a different sort of repetition: that of generation.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In other words, at this level, difference serves repetition, and the result is the limitation of the whole that diminishes the random multiplica- tion (of species, life-forms, cross-species changes) and puts it in the service of (a particular species’) generation, which is a limited kind of multiplication. However, evolution is not so simple, or so neatly confined, as species continue to evolve.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The processes of hesitation become a process of integration through the containment of the forces of multiplication within a limited whole. The deity becomes closely identified with its village. Its force of cosmo- logical multiplication (a deity that potentially harbors all deities within it) turns into a force of generation for the village. This is a largely agrarian sense of generation—the prolixity of grains and domestic beasts and male offspring. So it is that the limitation of multiplication to generation confirms the deity’s role in bestowing its blessing on the village’s productivity. This explains why the deity must hesitate, if it is to integrate social opposition into the collective of the ritual event, infinitesimally. The deity’s act of integration can (and usually does) have territorial implications (this is its village), and the deity may serve to integrate social opposition into a territorial or ethnic subject. However, many actions within the ritual event work simulta-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 269</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">neously to open up the multiplicity of the gods, resulting in “interfer- ences between imitative currents”,<span class="s9">7  </span>which turns repetition into a force which serves difference.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moving the gods—<span class="p">Sheng </span>and <span class="p">Ling </span>practices</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">If the movements of the deities can be confined to the repetition of paired oppositions in order to generate a conservative force of repeti- tion of the same eternally, there are other aspects of the invocations of the gods that disrupt these oppositions. While the deity is being moved from the temple in a sedan chair around the village or the alliance, the ritual masters are simultaneously inviting the deity to the altar of the higher gods. Spirit mediums are sporadically possessed by the gods as well.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Sheng <span class="p">practices involve a process of sensory-motor experimentation not unlike what Tarde thinks of as invention, or as Deleuze points out, “infinitesimal social adaptation”.

Surely this is why esoteric approaches often have such an easy relation with the powers at hand, and with state formations.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">However, the problem for <i>sheng </i>processes is that it is always in a paradoxical relationship with the heights (or the depths) of identifi- cation with the gods.

Simply put, there is a paradox within <i>sheng </i>practices: because the deity at the pinnacle is ultimately multiple, the practitioner cannot simply ascend to the peak; the adept must simultaneously move sideways, eccentrically, toward potentially infinite centers. In order to overcome this infinite drift, the ritual master has to constantly experiment with different techniques.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">At the other extreme is what we call <i>ling</i>, best exemplified in spirit possession, that is, possession by a deity or demon, which involves trance, loss of self, spontaneous and uncontrolled bodily movements, and speaking in the voices of gods. <i>Ling </i>appears to be all depth. Its depth comes not of a simple outside, nor is <i>ling </i>an inner depth (inte- riority) in relation to <i>sheng</i>. It recalls the “inside of the outside” evoked in Deleuze’s discussion of Foucault (Deleuze 1988: 120). The loss of self in trance, for instance, implicates an inside deeper than interiority, one that is also ecstatic (opening to outside)—limbs twitching and tongues speaking in response to the deities’ passage. <i>Ling </i>might be thought of as a radical scrambling of all the material and sensory paraphernalia of esoteric practices. <i>Ling </i>appears closer to what Deleuze calls “the deeper level” of Tarde’s laws at which “repetition serves difference” (Deleuze 1994: 312–13, n. 3). <i>Ling </i>is a form of infinitesimal diffusion (adaptation), but it is “diffusion as repetition of perturbation”. <i>Ling </i>is sensory-motor perturbation as infinitesimal social diffusion, leading to non-hierarchized integration.<span class="s9">8 </span>To return to the feedback model intro- duced above in relation to the force field of the ritual event, this kind of perturbation can suddenly transform the entire field in unexpected ways by working primarily at the affective, infra-corporeal and inter- corporeal levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This section has outlined three instances of Tarde’s laws of imita- tion, opposition, and adaptation in relation to aspects of the ritual event. 1) We examined processes of opposition in the hesitation and duplicity of the deity interpreted as infinitesimal social opposition that had the effect of social integration and collective identification,<span class="s9">9</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_150.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">8 <span class="s7">Ecstatic trance states can be transmitted instantaneously through a crowd at a Chinese ritual event.

At the <i>sheng </i>pole we found that the regulated actions of the ritual masters were on the one hand a form of inte- grated repetition (as in a feedback model). However, at the individual practitioner’s experiential level this entailed constant sensory-motor experimentation with the decoding of hierarchical structures in search of identification with the gods, which can also be seen as a kind of infinitesimal social adaptation through the invention of techniques. Finally we examined the diffusion of perturbation in trance-like expe- riences as infinitesimal social diffusion. Taking up a feedback model again, all these processes can give rise to unanticipated interactions and changes across the system. Each of these examples point to an understanding of ritual as not simply a form of imitation as a repeti- tion of the same, but instead as an opening up of repetition (imitation) to the power of difference in itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -100pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;">Movement of the gods—movement through multiple nodes of perception</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The movements of the deities—in loops around the village territory, or in repeated invocations to the altar of the ritual masters, or in spo- radic possession of the spirit mediums—generate multiple nodes of perception in the overall ritual event. These movements spin minor resonant loops—some planned, others spontaneous—that become minor worlds in the sense that they are performative sites with coher- ent viewing positions. In this respect as well, the movement of the gods fits the model of feedback and transformation. The deities are a kind of immanent cause—a non-localizable symmetry-breaking that generates new phases by dephasing—nevertheless the deities, like the metastable state, remain immanent in the phases.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Performative nodes also spring up around ritual objects such as the incense burner or the palanquin, or even around the opera perfor- mance—they are like monadic points of view on the ritual event. It is possible to see and experience the entire ritual event from any one of these nodes. In fact, some villagers are clearly there for the opera, oth- ers to ogle the crowd or to eat, while others arrive to entreat the dei- ties. Of course, each node sees some parts of the event more distinctly and others more obscurely; each has its truth.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">272 chapter ten</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The many eyes of the  gods</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The ritual event is nonetheless able to cohere, because one always has recourse to the deities in order to say, “I didn’t see the ritual masters summon the deities, but I know this took place, and so my experi- ence is relative to that overall event.” In this way, the overall truth of the ritual event is preserved, and the formation of different nodes of performance and viewing positions does not undermine the position of the deities. So as long as the deities provide some kind of overall view, the different nodes of the event do not become entirely self-ref- erential; they remain open to the deities and to one another. Indeed the ritual event does imply something like a supreme or all-gathering witness—such as heaven, or the pantheon of the gods.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">However, such a view of the ritual event represents the view from above in which: everything moves from the top down, from the great innovator to the masses, from a god-like creator to the worlds. It also places difference at the service of repetition, in which the difference between action-minds becomes homogeneous, implying some kind of pre-established harmony among them. Tarde’s microsociology bids us to turn to a deeper level at which repetition “is what enables us to pass from one order of difference to another . . . Repetition, therefore, is not the process by which difference is augmented and diminished, but the process by which it ‘goes on differing’ and ‘takes itself as its end’”. It is a “difference ‘which opposes nothing and which serves no purpose’, which is ‘the final end of all things.’” (Deleuze1994: 312–13, n. 3).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The relation between the different nodes of perception in the ritual event is closer to Bakhtin’s sense of polyphony than to Leibniz’s pre- established harmony. Bakhtin was interested in festival and carnival, and in the multitude’s overturning of established hierarchies and har- monies. At some deeper level, the ritual event is always a matter of the “differently different”, even when it seems to result in the re-affirma- tion of local power structures replete with inequalities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Ritual autonomy and global  capitalism</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The ritual event is characterized by the great potential for autonomy each node of perception has in relation to other nodes and to the dei- ties. This is precisely why ritual activities in Fujian province are able to serve as conduits for, and refractors of, state capital, global capital, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 273</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">local economies. The danger, of course, is that local, state, or global formations will exploit the autonomies of the ritual event in order to frame the temporality of modernity against the multiple tempo- ralities of the ritual event, as a simple and indifferent opposition. The best could hope for in such circumstances would be a form of alterna- tive modernity, which would simply delay the inevitable subsumption of all relations by capital. This is a real danger because the power of capital also lies in its immanence, in its ability to work within and transform hierarchical formations of local powers. This movement of capital tends to generate contradictions in the ritual space of non-con- tradictions, which then usually demand resolution in the form of local or national identity.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Both ritual and capital produce worlds. As Lazzarato puts it, “How to understand concepts of labor, production, cooperation and com- munication when capitalism is not only a mode of production but <i>a production of worlds</i>?” (Lazzarato 2004). The infinitesimal world pro- duction of the ritual event asks us to think differently from capital but not oppositionally. It bids us to consider the differently differ- ent between capital and ritual. For the ritual event is not simply an obstacle to the movement of capital or a contradiction within it. The promise of a microsociology of contemporary ritual activities in south- east China lies in the attention it calls to its production of worlds. This ability of the ritual event opens into questions about the local evolu- tion of historical technologies of the subject in the Putian plains, such as the ritual power formation briefly introduced above. The continu- ing power of these ritual events to absorb and yet not be completely transformed by flows of global capital raises important questions as to the negotiation of modernity in contemporary Putian.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summary of concluding questions</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In a lecture delivered in Japan, Michel Foucault drew some compari- sons between pastoral power and the impact of Confucianism in China and Japan:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">. . . it would be worthwhile to compare the pastorate, the pastoral power of Christian societies, with that which may have been the role and the effects of Confucianism in the societies of the Far East. One must note the quasi-coincidental timing of the two, one must note how the role of pastoral power was important in the formation of the State in the 16th</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">274 chapter ten</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">and the 18th centuries in Europe, a bit like Confucianism had been in Japan in the Tokutawa (sic) era. But one must also make a difference between pastoral power and Confucianism: the pastorate was essentially religious, Confucianism was not; the pastorate grasped an objective situ- ated in the beyond and never intervened here below except as a function of that beyond, whereas Confucianism played essentially a terrestrial role; Confucianism grasped a general stability in the social body by a set of general rules which are imposed either on every individual or on each category of individual, whereas the pastorate established a relation of individualized obedience between the pastor and his flock; finally, the pastorate had, by means of the techniques it employed (spiritual direc- tion, care for the soul) individualizing effects which Confucianism did not carry.

The West has never known the equivalent of Confucianism, that is to say a form of thinking which, in reflecting on the order of the world, or in establishing it, prescribes at the same time the structure of the State, the form of social relations, and the conduct of individuals, and which prescribes these effectively in the reality of history. (<i>Dits et Ecrits</i>, 3.538).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">But Foucault was at least aware that other traditions and techniques of the body were practiced in Japan, as can be seen in his brief remarks on the importance of posture (Zen sitting) on the occasion of a visit to a Zen monastery. As Sakai and Solomon (2006) have recently pointed out, Foucault is aware of the impasse of isolated Western thought and calls for a new philosophy to emerge outside the parameters of Western imperialism. Yet in other respects, his discourse falls back upon cul- tural essentialism and Orientalism. Clearly, Foucault had little knowl- edge or understanding of the complexities of East Asian cultures and its many varied technologies of the self and forms of subjectivation.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Contrary to Foucault’s assumptions about the unchanging, all- powerful nature of Confucianism throughout Chinese history, one can detect a number of major shifts within Confucianism itself, and its relation to power and ideology in Chinese history. However, one can take up Foucault’s methods and discover within Chinese history the formation of a number of new regimes of power combining words</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 275</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">(discursive regimes) and things (institutions and visual regimes) in unanticipated ways. One such historical break—the rise of a new for- mation of power which we call ritual power, which began to emerge in Southeast China in the 16th century, in the late Ming, centered on the ritual events of popular religious temples and regional ritual alliances.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The elements that combine in this new flow/form of power can- not in fact all be termed Confucian. Nevertheless, even mainstream Neo-Confucianism underwent major changes. The most significant for the processes described in here was the challenge posed by the Heart- Mind School of Neo-Confucian philosophy of Wang Yangming in the 16th century to the mainstream Neo-Confucian School of Principle of Zhu Xi (1120–1200). If the structural homologies mentioned above by Foucault between state and family and individual propriety had been a major feature of the 12th–13th century Zheng-Zhu School, by the 16th century a great many cracks had appeared in the ideological system. Wang Yangming’s efforts to repair these breakdowns through an emphasis on <i>liangzhi </i><span class="s12">良知 </span>(intuitive understanding of the good) opened the way to a range of radical local reform initiatives by his followers, especially in Jiangxi and Zhejiang (such as the Taigu philo- sophic and religious movement). In particular, the philosophy of Li Zhi <span class="s12">李贄 </span>(1527–1602), whose early attack on the hypocrisy of con- ventional Confucianism, his assault on the status of classics, and his championing of popular literature and bodily self-cultivation seems to prefigure later critiques by Japanese scholars such as Ogai and Ito (Sakai 1991). However, we do not argue here that these developments in the history of ideas explain the epistemic shift in the late Ming. On the contrary, they can be seen as one element in the emergence of a new discursive regime which explored the powers of the local and the regional in new ways. In several mid-Ming inscriptions from Putian in the late 16th century one finds the key claim that <i>li yi yi qi </i>“(Ritual arises from the intentions (of the ritual participants)”. This is in fact a radical claim for innovation in ritual practice, and can be found already in the Cheng Zhu school of NeoConfucianism. What is striking about these inscriptions is that they are not primarily philo- sophic interventions, but instead concrete monuments inscribed in the space of ritual activities inside temples within the emergent ritual alli- ances of Putian. In the late Ming, many followers of Wang Yangming were social activists who did not contribute to the increasingly ster- ile debates between the philosophic schools, but who instead devoted</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">276 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">their lives to forming new alliances with local groups and movements, including the emergent temple networks of the Putian region. In this context, the rise of the Three in One movement can be understood as a radical effort to apply Confucian self-cultivation to both individual pursuit of enlightenment and to a broad-based reform of social moral- ity (through the force of example of the conduct and the ritual practice of members of the movement).</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The newly emergent power formation of late Ming China can be referred to as ‘ritual power formation’. This mode of production and performance of power was built upon the ‘non-relation’ of the evolv- ing rituals of local religion, which rather than imposing a particular ideology or belief system, managed instead to generate the linking together of a range of new institutions, new ritual forms and liturgical frameworks, and performative regimes and processes of subjectivation, regardless of any seeming contradictions or incompatibilities. These new institutions and regimes of expression/performance include gene- alogical inscriptions of (ritual) identity in lineage formations which soon mutated beyond Confucian models, new modes of local mobili- zation, self-organization, self-regulation and self-definition embodied in community compacts and local temple organizations, and further expressed in epigraphical and scriptural accounts of the local gods and their myths, and a range of new performative expressions of the manifestation of power within shifting local pantheons in the many emerging forms of regional opera, the newly forming popular novels, and local performances of spirit possession and spirit-writing. Ritual power can be explored as a newly emergent diagrammatic flowchart of power that circulates in the interstices between newly developed networks and institutions in late Ming Putian. Ritual power generates new forms of subjectivation, new registers of identity, new techniques of the body, and new forms of mobilization and organization of the village communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">This ritual power formation can be understood as one kind of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">“cultural nexus of power” as described by Duara (1988) in relation to Shandong in the late 19th and early 20th century. Duara noted many of the elements that make up what he described as “the cultural nexus of power”: temple networks, lineages, irrigation societies, and crop- watching associations, but he did not examine in great detail the his- tory of the Shandong nexus. Other local cultures of China developed their own unique nexuses of power, composed of a different configu- ration of elements, and undergoing distinct historical developments in separate parts of China.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 277</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In contrast to the rather apocalyptic tone of Duara’s (1988) discus- sion of the destructive impact of modernity upon the “cultural nexus of power” in Shandong, the recent resurgence of ritual alliances in the Putian plain demonstrates that cultural nexuses can continue to evolve even after the shock of the impacts of modernizations (whether Mao- ist, socialist with Chinese characteristics, or increasingly capitalist and globalized). The current “cultural nexus of power” in the Putian plains can be traced back to the rise of a new ritual power formation begin- ning in the mid-Ming. By mobilizing the local population through ritual means, Ming Putian elites found a way to assert control over the maintenance of the irrigation system in a situation where compromise and mutual assistance was imposed by the environmental limits of the irrigation system. This would indicate a major change from lineage based power to temple based multi-lineage patterns of control and maintenance of the irrigation system.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">An ecological grid of rationality subtends the ritual alliances which</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">developed out of and in relation to the irrigation system. This net- work of coastal tides, rivers, channels, canals, sluice-gates, reservoirs, and paddy-fields, along with their natural villages, village temples, and higher order temples, provided the underlying framework similar to that provided by the agricultural lands of the parishes, village churches and cathedrals of the Catholic church in the pastoral power formation described by Foucault. These ritual alliances transformed early models of kinship, perhaps more closely tied to Foucault’s vision of Confu- cianism, by deterritorializing and dispersing lineages, and by absorb- ing them throughout a broad range of ritual activities. This process was one of many potential (and ongoing) transformations of the Chinese lineage, which in many cases in the Putian area became something closer to a transnational joint stock corporation, with membership shares for sale. Transversal connections between networks became an important feature of these emergent ritual alliances, as higher order temples and processions were established. In some respects, although these new connections were taking place in a polytheistic ritual sphere, there was little appeal to a transcendental realm, as was the case in the pastoral power formation described by Foucault. In that case, pastoral power’s individualizing and totalizing tendencies paved the way for the transition from a sovereign mode of power to a modern disci- plinary society and later to a society of control. In the local Putian context, one can find at this period emergent levels of local autonomy within ritual power formations that achieve some independence from homologies of imperial sovereign power.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">278 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">A broad range of official institutional reforms were adopted by the Ming and Qing courts, but what is more interesting from the perspec- tive of local history is the unintended consequences of these reforms as seen in the mutations these institutions underwent in the Putian plains. Each of these local mutations evolved into networks throughout the region, which in turn interacted with other networks, generating new formations and potentialities. As each network developed, they gen- erated unexpected effects on other networks, or reached bifurcation points in their own developments that transformed them through link- ages with other networks. The complex interactions between different networks generated new potentialities within the evolving system. The changing “consistencies of relations” generated in this process would have been experienced as a process of cultural experimentation by vil- lagers and local cultural mediators in the Putian plains. One might ask which networks were available to which agents in villages at different periods in Putian history. What forces (economic, human, cosmologi- cal) were mobilized within these different networks, and how did these networks transform the subjectivities of their participants? And how did geographic configurations generate ecological constraints on the development of these multi-layered networks?</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Any network consists of its points or nodes, the lines between these</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">points, or its links, and the flows between them—each of these three aspects is of equal importance. The complexity of the relations within each node (village, or other association), for example, those between lineages, social classes, genders, or other temple communities, will effect that node’s relations with other nodes in the network. A poten- tially very large number of networks may overlap in a single village- node, linking that village to different networks. The complexity of the networks available to any village reflects the variety of spatial rela- tions (virtual, imaginary, or spatially extended alliances) that could be accessed, no doubt unequally, by different villagers. We might ask of these ritual networks to what degree they overlap with political space, market hierarchies, transnational networks, or other religious spaces. What kind of elements (technological changes, experimental social or religious movements, innovations in cultural management) moved transversally through different networks, in blocks of becoming that generated new social and cultural possibilities?</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">When one traces the various vertical lines of institutional change</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">over time, one can follow the cracks that form as the lines give rise to blocks of becoming that move across state-society relations in unpre-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 279</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">dictable ways. For although the people of Putian were deeply imbued with Confucian cultural values, they were never simply a blank slate, or an uncarved block passively awaiting further Confucianization. Rich local ritual traditions were expressed in the ritual events of many groups and ethnicities in Tang and Song Putian. In time this region would become the most successful of all the regions in China in terms of the production of officials. They also were amongst the first regions to experiment with lineage forms of ancestral worship, a point noted with some awe by Zhu Xi, who may have sensed that developments in ancestral worship in Putian were rapidly morphing away from his own stricter and more limited model of worship. But rather than abandon past experience and modalities in a whole-scale conversion to Confu- cianism, the cultural resources of the Putian area continued to pile up new dimensions on the ‘plane of non-contradiction’. Successive state institutional initiatives encountered an incomprehensibly complex ground of local and trans-regional ritual traditions, cult networks, vol- untary associations, kin and pseudo-kinship groups, regional alliances, and flows of capital, ideas, images, and practices from throughout the Asian trading network.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">These regional ritual alliances are maintained by the repeated per-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">formance of rituals, including the invitation of the gods from their perches in the temples out into a procession first around the spiritual and territorial boundaries of the village, and then in a larger procession to the other villages of the alliance. Some larger processions combine several regional ritual alliances in circuits around 60 or 70 villages. At the center of these processions are rituals performed at the main vil- lage temples by Daoist ritual specialists, Three in One Ritual Masters, or other local ritual specialists. A vast assortment of individual wor- shippers, visiting delegations from allied villages, rotating temple lead- ers and their families, and patrons of opera performed for the gods all gather into the central spaces before the temples. Each family also pays an obligatory per capita fee to the temple, and arranges offerings and fireworks to greet the deities on their processions around the village. Ritual roles within the temple leadership, management of the ritual activities, and the concrete ritual roles within the procession and the larger ritual event are filled by rotation with representatives from each household. Accounts of temple income and expenditures are openly posted on the temple walls. This transparency of accounting is a cru- cial element of the openness of ritual power.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">280 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">These processes of collective mobilization and rotation of leadership are subjective technologies that are at the same time totalizing (at the level of the collective village) and individualizing (at the level of the <i>jia </i>(family) as a ritual unit).<span class="s9">10 </span>All families are mobilized for the ritual and the processions, and each family is eventually represented through rotation in the temple leadership committee. While one might argue that one serves on the temple management committee not as an indi- vidual, but as a category (a member of the community in good stand- ing), in fact this form of rotating leadership provides the opportunity for the expression of individual skills and enthusiasms, in the areas of managerial skill and reasoned consensus building. Similar scope for individual expression is found in the performative dimension of many of the roles in the ritual event.<span class="s9">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">It is important to point out that just as the network of regional</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ritual alliances has been evolving for over 500 years, so too the ritual system is an open-ended one, open to innovation and in fact insis- tent on change, competitive performance, and the absorption of new socio-economic and political forces. Such an approach challenges the claims for cultural hegemony and unity in sinological studies of late imperial China. After reacting against extreme claims regarding totalitarian control in Qing China by Wittfogel and his student Hsiao Kung-ch’uan, many scholars in the ’70s and ’80’s veered in the oppo- site direction, and attempted to highlight the positive aspects of Qing administration by exploring the role of the state and the “good offi- cial” in famine relief, flood control, or irrigation projects. Meanwhile, anthropologists and historians increasingly turned to a cultural hege- monic model to explain the purported unity of Chinese culture and the political control of the Qing empire. Thus theories have been proposed of a symbolic system that featured “hierarchical encompassment” that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_151.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">10 <span class="s7">The totalizing aspect of the pastoral power (all souls under God) and its individu- alizing effects (the confession of sin as the truth telling of each individual under the watch of the pastor) worked at a simultaneously very abstract theological level (sin) and at an intensely personal level (guilt and shame, and their absolution via ritual). These qualities of abstract totality and individuation would be reprised in a differ- ent formation of power under the modern nation state with the rise of nationalism and individual rights. Very different but equally strong power relations and modes of individuation are at work in village ritual orders, whether based in lineage formations, temple alliances, or a combination of both.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;">11 <span class="s7">The discussion of microsociology above suggests the need to move beyond crude dichotomies of individual versus group identity, and to take into account the mul- tiple layers of perception, awareness, agency and responsiveness at work within ritual performativity.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions: ritual and modernity 281</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">continually recuperates and overcomes challenges to the symbolic order (Sangren 1987). Other approaches (Watson 1985) have argued for “orthopractic” control, arguing that ritual form was standardized across the empire without regard for local interpretations of the mean- ings of the rites, leading nevertheless to cultural and political unity and control. Recently some historians (Rawski 1998) have focused on the strategic emphasis on ritual in the Qing court, again showing the role of ritual practice in achieving cultural hegemony. Faure (2007) has argued for the spread of Confucian social models of lineage forma- tions, along with lineage ritual, as a key element in the achievement of cultural identification with the State—a process he charts for the Pearl River delta in the 16th century, but which he argues occurred at different times via a combination of means in various parts of China. The emphasis is once again on cultural process of unification. Faure (2007) charts a gentrification of society, in which the newly arisen gen- try strives for ever more legitimacy from the state.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In contrast to these approaches, it is possible to examine the forma-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">tion of a new regime of power from below as it took different forms in different times and places. However, rather than conceiving of this power from below in terms of a social revolution or a form of resis- tance constantly displacing or temporarily inverting imperial power, it would be interesting to think instead in terms of a third term: namely the formation of new kinds of bodies and communities within new technologies of subjectivity. Rather than abandoning past experiences and modalities in a whole-scale conversion to Confucianism, the cul- tural resources of the Putian area continued to pile up new dimensions within an expanding cultural reservoir.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Thinking local or regional history from the point of view of locally emergent modes of power does not deny the rather overwhelming evi- dence for the high degree of the cultural hegemony of the Confucian state in late imperial China—but it does show the limits of such analy- sis. No doubt there were many local cultural nexuses of power, different power formations, including ritual-power formations, lineage-power formations, and a wide variety of other local modes of channeling and organizing power across China. Rather than see power only from the imperial perspective as the imposition of a culturally defined unified, hierarchically encompassing, continuum of cosmic authority stretch- ing from the Altar of Heaven to each household shrine to the stove god, we can instead make out a far more complex landscape of alterna- tive workings of local powers and local performances of power.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">282 chapter ten</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The meeting point of many of these networks and formations of power were the ritual events of local religion. These ritual events are embedded in historically complex processes of the construction of spa- tial nodes of multiple networks. These ritual events capture, deform, and transduce lines of force, whether these be forces of state or lineage or cult territorialization, or capitalist, technological, or cultural forces of deterritorialization. In other words, these singular ritual events and the changing forces they produce and mobilize have been involved in a constantly changing negotiation with capital and different state and social formations for centuries.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">How were these different institutions and regimes of enunciation held together? Ritual performance has been mentioned above as a pri- mary venue for expression of these new power relations. Indeed, as Geertz argued in relation to Bali, the performance of these rituals was the performance of power. The question is what kind of power? In the ritual events of the Putian plain the power being generated and per- formed is that of particular communities or ritual alliances expressing a degree of autonomy. One of those powers is the power to generate worlds of difference within ritual that are not absorbed into modern- ization (cultural tourism) or state control (cultural museumification) but remain vital cosmopolitical resources for villagers in the contem- porary Putian region (see Dean and Lamarre 2003; 2007).<span class="s9">12</span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">If the temple networks of some areas of Putian can now be said to</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">form a “second government”, one which provide services to the locale but also collect funds and mobilizes village populations, then we can see this sector of local governance and relative local autonomy as hav- ing evolved slowly since the mid-Ming, and as having shown an ability to respond to the retreat of the state from control over everyday life in imperial as well as contemporary China. The history of this gradual establishment of the institutions, techniques, and practices of local autonomy is an important chapter in the socio-cultural development of China with many implications for the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_152.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">12 </span>This form of popular performative communal ritual activity requires a rethinking of the theory of <i>kyokutai </i>or <i>gongtongti </i>in both Japanese and Western Sinology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PART TWO</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: center;">LINEAGE AND RELIGION ON THE PUTIAN PLAINS: AN ANALYSIS BASED ON STONE INSCRIPTIONS</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: center;">by Zheng Zhenman translated by Kenneth  Dean</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: center;">LINEAGE AND RELIGION ON THE PUTIAN PLAINS: AN ANALYSIS BASED ON STONE INSCRIPTIONS<span class="s9">1</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;">Zheng Zhenman translated by Kenneth Dean</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Introduction</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Putian plain is situated on the Xinghua bay in the middle of the Fujian coast in Southeast China. The total area of the irrigated plain is 464 sq. km., making it the third largest coastal plain in Fujian. Accord- ing to geological investigations, the Putian plain was originally under some 30 meters of seawater. The original coastline was formed by the Nangshan mountain to the north, the Jiuhua and Guishan mountains to the west, and the Hugong and Wuhou mountains to the south, all of which together formed a C shaped coastline. The Mulan river, which originates in the higher mountains of central Fujian, and the Yanshou and Qiulu rivers, wind their ways into the Putian plain from the north and the west, and then flow into the sea. Over centuries leading up to the Tang dynasty, these rivers had deposited silt which was pushed into a thin but fertile crescent-shaped alluvial plain by the actions of the sea. Putian is first mentioned in historical sources in 564, when the region was known as Pukou “<span class="s12">蒲口</span>”, implying the mouth of a river covered with abundant reeds. Another early name for the region was “<span class="s12">蒲田</span>” or “plain of reeds”. In the Tang, the name was simplified to Putian, eliminating the reference to water plants.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">From Chen Guangda 2 (568) to Sui Kaihuang 9 (589), the admin-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">istrative center of Putian was twice established, but each time it was allowed to collapse.

This new administrative region closely matches the current shape of the greater Putian area.

This process involved the establishment of irrigation systems and the reclaiming of piece after piece of land from the sea. The construction of the irrigation systems was the most important fac- tor in this development. The history of the irrigation of the Putian plain can be divided into three main phases: 1) from the mid-Tang to the Five Dynasties during which time the main goal was the dig- ging of reservoirs to store fresh water; 2) from the Northern Song to the Southern Song, characterized by the construction of weirs and the digging of irrigation canals; and 3) from the Yuan to the mid-Ming, with the elaboration of the system of irrigation canals and second- ary channels and the expansion and continual construction of sea dikes. Through a long process of the construction of irrigation and the reclamation of land from the sea, three large and relatively inde- pendent irrigation systems were developed. These are the Nanyang (Southern irrigated plain) with the Mulan weir <span class="s12">木 蘭 陂 </span>at its origin, the Beiyang Northern irrigated plain <span class="s12">北 洋 </span>with the Yanshou weir <span class="s12">延 壽 陂 </span>, the Taiping weir <span class="s12">太 平 陂 </span>, and the Shihua weir <span class="s12">使 華 陂 </span>at its multiple starting points, and the Jiuliyang <span class="s12">九 里 洋 </span>, with the Nan’an weir <span class="s12">南 安 陂 </span>at its origin.<span class="s9">4</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_154.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">2 </span>See the Qianlong edition of the <i>Putian xianzhi </i><span class="s16">《莆田縣志》</span>, j.1 <i>Yudizhi </i><span class="s16">舆地志</span>, reprinted in Guangxu 5 (1879) 1–5.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">3 </span>See the Putian Toponym Committee <span class="s16">莆田縣地名辦公室編 </span>ed., <i>Putian diminglu (Putian register of place names) </i><span class="s16">莆田地名錄</span>, 1982. 9, 16, 23, 33, 41, 47, 57, 65, 73, 163, 173.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">4 </span>See Li Tingshui <span class="s16">林汀水</span>: ”Cong dixue guandian kan Putian pingyuan de kaifa (From a geographical perspective looking at the development of the Putian plain<span class="s16">從地理學觀點看莆田平原的開發</span>” in <i>Zhongguo shehui jingjishi yanjiu (Journal of Chinese socio-economic history) </i><span class="s16">中國社會經濟史研究</span>, 1986.2; see also Morita Akira<span class="s16">森田明</span>. 1962. “Fukkenshō ni okeru suiri kyōdōtai ni tsuite” <span class="s16">福建省における水利共同體について</span>”, in <i>Rekishigaku kenkyū </i><span class="s16">歷史學研究 </span><i>(Historical Research)</i>, Vol. 261:19–28.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 287</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The shape and distribution of villages in the Putian coastal area is closely linked to the development of the irrigation systems. Settlements in the area prior to the Song were mostly along the edges of the coastal plain in protected mountain valleys and low lying hills, especially those close to sources of fresh water such as valley streams and coastal res- ervoirs. Because large scale irrigation had not been developed, these settlements were widely scattered, and there must have been many boat people living off fishing along the coast.<span class="s9">5 </span>Over the Song and Yuan dynasties, following the gradual expansion of the great irrigation sys- tems, settlements spread into the center of the plain and along the coast. These newly established settlements usually had corresponding irrigation canals and protective dikes, therefore many of them have the words “<span class="s12">塘 </span>tang (reservoir)”, “<span class="s12">埭 </span>dai (dike)”, or “<span class="s12">墩 </span>dun (mound)” as part of their names. During the Ming and Qing, new mudflats (<i>dai- tian</i>) were constantly being reclaimed from the sea beyond the sea- walls, so that we find the expressions “first dike”, “second dike” and “third dike”. The number of coastal villages in these newly reclaimed zones continued to expand. By the late Qing, the Mulan irrigation system of the Southern plain provided water to 102 villages, while the Yanshou irrigation system of the Northern plain serviced 172 villages, while the Taiping irrigation system watered 28 villages, and the Shihua weir system irrigated 29 villages.<span class="s9">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In the history of the development of Putian, lineages and religious</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">organizations have played major roles. After the Yanshou Weir and its main irrigation canals were established in the Northern Plain in the mid Tang (780–783), several large lineage groups each began separately to reclaim patches of land from the sea, establishing various indepen- dent reservoirs and dikes, such as the Lindai dike <span class="s12">林埭</span>, the Yetang res- ervoir <span class="s12">葉塘</span>, the Lintang reservoir <span class="s12">林塘</span>, the Wangtang reservoir <span class="s12">王塘</span>, the minor Lintang reservoir <span class="s12">小林塘</span>, the Chentang reservoir <span class="s12">陳塘</span>, the Fangdai dike <span class="s12">方埭</span>, the Weitang reservoir, <span class="s12">魏塘</span>, the Chendai dike<span class="s12">陳埭</span>, the Sutang reservoir <span class="s12">蘇塘</span>, the Youtang reservoir <span class="s12">游塘</span>, and the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_155.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">5 </span>According to the Hongzhi <i>Xinghua fuzhi </i><span class="s16">興化府志 </span>and the Qianlong <i>Putian xianzhi </i><span class="s16">莆田縣志 </span>in the Ming there were three Hebosuo <span class="s16">河泊所 </span>(Fishery Tax Sta- tions) established in Putian, which each year took in 2,500 piculs of “fishery rice tax” “<span class="s16">鱼課米</span>”.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">6 </span>See Chen Chiyang <span class="s16">陳池養</span>, <i>Putian shuilizhi </i>(<i>Putian irrigation gazetteer</i>) <span class="s16">莆田水利志</span>, j.2. <i>Beitang </i>(Weirs and reservoirs) <span class="s16">陂塘</span>.

Amongst these there were several monastic estates reclaiming stretches of land  such as the Guohuan monastic estate<span class="s12">國懽院田</span>, the Cishou monastic estate <span class="s12">慈壽院田</span>, and the Shangsheng monastic estate <span class="s12">上生院田</span>. At the time of the construction of the Mulan weir in the Southern Irrigated plain in 1068–1077, the three Yu <span class="s12">三余 </span>the seven Zhu <span class="s12">七朱</span>, the Lin <span class="s12">林</span>, Chen <span class="s12">陳</span>, Wu <span class="s12">吳 </span>and the Gu<span class="s12">顾</span>—who made up the “Fourteen Surnames” <span class="s12">十四大家</span>, donated funds and labor, as well as land for the digging of canals. Afterwards, these Fourteen Surnames, or as they were also referred to, the Meritorious Ministers, for a long time controlled the irrigation system, and became the most influential social group in the area. When the Taiping Weir was built in the Northern Irrigated plain in 1056–1063, it was first managed by the Eight Great Surnames, but later it was taken over by the Buddhist monks of Nangshan Monastery. The date of construction of the Shihua Weir in the Northern irrigated plain is unclear, but from the early Ming the irrigation system was under the control of the Fang lineage. The Nanan Weir was constructed in 977, but in the Southern Song and the Ming it was controlled in succession by the Fang, the Huang and the Wang lineages, who managed its reconstruction. The coastal areas of the Jiuliyang irrigated plain were also reclaimed by various lineages independently, as can be seen by the names of villages and reclaimed land in that region such as Wudun Mound <span class="s12">ª墩</span>, You- dun Mound <span class="s12">游墩</span>, Chen mound <span class="s12">陳墩, </span>Oudai dike <span class="s12">歐埭</span>, Hedai dike<span class="s12">何埭</span>, Zhuodai dike <span class="s12">卓埭</span>, and Eastern Caidai dike <span class="s12">東蔡埭</span>.<span class="s9">7</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The historical  evolution  of  irrigation  systems,  the  environmental constraints on settlements, and the modes of lineage and religious organization all had determining influences on the construction of the space of activity of local Putian society. Due to limitations of space, this introduction will not attempt a deep analysis of the inner con- nections of these different social spaces, but it should be emphasized that the evolution of lineage forms and religious organizations in the Putian plains were controlled to a large degree by the development of the irrigation system and the physical environment of the local settle- ments. Therefore, when conducting comparative studies in regional history, considerable importance should be given to physical geogra- phy and environmental dimensions of social life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_156.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s10">7   </span>Chen Chiyang <span class="s16">陳池養</span>, <i>Putian shuilizhi </i><span class="s16">莆田水利志</span>, j. 2, 3: Weirs and Reservoirs</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">陂塘<span class="s7">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">lineage and religion on the putian plains</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Buddhism and powerful lineages in the early period</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">289</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The spread of Buddhism into the Putian region can be traced back to the Southern Dynasties. It is claimed that in the period between the Liang and the Chen dynasties, when the Confucian scholar Zheng Lu<span class="s12">鄭露 </span>built a study called the Nanhu Thatched Hut <span class="s12">南湖草堂 </span>at the base of the Phoenix mountain <span class="s12">鳳凰山</span>, a spirit being requested that he bequeath the land to found a Buddhist monastery. Subsequently in 558 the Thatched Hut was changed into the Hall of the Golden Immortal<span class="s12">金仙院</span>, becoming the first Buddhist site in recorded Putian history. In 589 the Hall became the Golden Immortal Monastery <span class="s12">金仙院寺 </span>and in 711 it received an imperial plaque changing its name to Lingyan (Numinous Peak) <span class="s12">靈巖</span>. In the Song Taiping Xingguo reign period (976–984), it was imperially honored with a new name, Guanghua <span class="s12">廣化 </span>(Broad Transformation), which it has kept to this day. From the Southern Dynasties to the end of the Tang, several other renowned Buddhist monasteries were built in Putian coastal region, including the Baoshenyuan on Hugong mountain <span class="s12">壺公山寶勝院</span>, the Wanan Shuiluyuan <span class="s12">萬安水陸院</span>, the Baorui Lingguangsi <span class="s12">保瑞靈光寺</span>, the Yujian Huayansi <span class="s12">玉澗華嚴寺</span>, the Guiyang Linggan chanyuan <span class="s12">龜山靈感禅院</span>, the Nangshan Cishousi <span class="s12">囊山慈壽寺</span>, the Zhongheyuan on Hugong Mountain <span class="s12">壺公山中和院</span>, the Shangshensi in Hanjiang<span class="s12">涵江上生寺</span>, the Shengshouyuan in Jiangkou <span class="s12">江口聖壽院</span>, the Zha- ofuyuan on Taiping mountain <span class="s12">太平山招福院</span>. Tang Buddhist cul- ture was very advanced in Putian as seen in the lives and writings of accomplished monks such as Wuji <span class="s12">無際</span>, Zhiyan <span class="s12">志彦</span>, Fatong <span class="s12">法通</span>, Wuliao <span class="s12">無了</span>, Miaoying <span class="s12">妙應</span>, and Benji of Caoshan <span class="s12">曹山本寂</span>. Of these, Zhiyan was summoned to court to lecture on the <i>Sifenlü </i><span class="s12">四分律</span>, Wuliao became a “flesh Buddha” <span class="s12">肉身佛</span>, Miaoying was known as both a god and a Buddha <span class="s12">神僧 </span>and Benji <span class="s12">本寂 </span>is known as the sec- ond patriarch of the Caotong branch of Chan Buddhism <span class="s12">曹洞宗二祖</span>, although he was in fact its founder.<span class="s9">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">When Tang Wuzong <span class="s12">唐武宗 </span>in 845 “memorialized calling for the destruction of all Buddhist monasteries, and for the reversion to secu- lar, commoner life of all the monks and nuns” the Buddhist monas- teries and minor halls of Putian were destroyed, and monks and nuns</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_157.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">8 </span>See Putian Religious Affairs Bureau, ed <i>Putian zongjiaozhi caogao (Putian County Religious Draft Gazetteer) </i><span class="s16">莆田宗教志初稿</span>, mimeograph edition, 1991.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">290 zheng zhenman</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">fled.<span class="s9">9 </span>When in the following years Tang Xuanzong <span class="s12">唐宣宗 </span>ordered the restoration of Buddhism, the monasteries of Putian were rebuilt and continued, flourishing until the end of the Tang. During the Five Dynasties, Wang Shenzhi promoted Buddhism, enabling Buddhist monastic estates in Fujian to expand exponentially, and Putian was no exception. The Song scholar Li Junfu <span class="s12">李俊甫 </span>in his <i>Puyang bishi </i><span class="s12">莆陽比事 </span>stated: “Wang Yanjun of the Min upheld the Buddhist law, and in a single year ordained 20, 000 monks. The great lineages of Putian competed to donate funds and property and build over 500 Buddhist monasteries”.<span class="s9">10 </span>The <i>Ming Hongzhi Xinghua Fuzhi </i><span class="s12">興化府志 </span>records that in the Southern Song there were 246 Buddhist establishments in Putian, and that their annual production for taxes came to 925 guan<span class="s12">貫 </span>662 <span class="s12">文</span>. According to the <i>Putianzhi</i>, edited in 1190–1194, the Nan- shan Guanghuasi <span class="s12">南山廣化寺</span>at its peak had over ten monastic estates, with over 120 an (smaller shrines or nunneries). “<span class="s12">别為院者十</span>, <span class="s12">為庵者百有二十</span>”. At this same time, on the “eight sides of Hugong moun- tain, there were formerly eighteen monasteries and thirty-six cliffside retreats”.<span class="s9">11 </span>Because these Buddhist monasteries had enormous power, their influence on local finance was huge. Liu Kezhuang <span class="s12">劉克莊 </span>com- mented in his <i>Da Xiangshou Pan Guanjiang </i><span class="s12">答鄉守潘官講 </span>that:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">I have carefully observed that the budgets of Putian and Fuzhou com- mandaries depend entirely on the Buddhist monasteries, and base their expenditures on the amounts they raise in taxes (from these monaster- ies).

Therefore good monks no longer are willing to live in the monasteries, and only those with begging bowls and no sense of shame put their names forward as abbots.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">某竊見莆、福郡計<span class="s13">, </span>全仰僧刹<span class="s13">, </span>率以献納多寡定去留。福謂之 <span class="s13">‘</span>實封<span class="s13">’,</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">莆謂之 <span class="s13">‘</span>助軍<span class="s13">’ </span>。故好僧不肯住院<span class="s13">, </span>惟有衣钵無廉耻者方投名求售。<span class="s13">12</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">By the end of the Southern Song, when financial pressure became too great, the monastic estates went into bankruptcy.

This was because it was forbid- den in the Tang and Song to worship one’s ancestors beyond the fourth generation, and the major lineages, in order to worship their ancestors and sacrifice at their graves, often established a Patron’s Shrine within a Buddhist monastery, or built a smaller Buddhist temple or shrine next to their ancestor’s tombs. Within the Nanshan Guanghuasi and its subsidiary temples and nunneries many of the great lineages set up Gongdeyuan <span class="s12">功德院 </span>Shrines in Honor of the Merit (of their ances- tors) or Baogongci <span class="s12">報功祠 </span>Shrines to Repay the Merit (of the ances- tors). These included the Nanhu Zheng lineage hall <span class="s12">南湖鄭氏祠堂 </span>on the right side of the Guanghuasi Fatang hall <span class="s12">廣化寺法堂</span>, the Fang ancestral shrine in the Jianfu Monastery <span class="s12">薦福院方氏祠堂</span>, the Huang Tao Shrine <span class="s12">黃祠堂 </span>in the Zhongzangan <span class="s12">中藏庵 </span>and the Pumenan<span class="s12">普門庵</span>, the Lin Zan Shrine in the Baogongan <span class="s12">報功庵林攢祠堂</span>, as well as the Gong lineage hall of Merit within the Chongxian Wenshu Monastery <span class="s12">崇先文殊院龔氏功德院</span>.<span class="s9">14 </span>In order to support these <i>citang </i>(shrines dedicated to ancestors) and to carry out sacrifices and wor- ship, each of the major lineages supported the Buddhist monasteries with regular donations of land and rents. This was probably the prin- cipal source of income of these monasteries at the time.

At the end of the Southern Song, due to the continuous decline of the Buddhist monastic economy, the great lineages began to directly enter into and manage the affairs of the monasteries, causing the monaster- ies to become even more dependent on them.

Thereupon the Jianfu Yuan (Monastery) had its start. Then they together donated thirty piculs (measure of grain pro- duced) of Baoshi farmlands. In addition, the Vice Director of the Pal- ace Library (Fang Renyue).gave seven piculs worth of land from Nanji, and three piculs worth of land from Nanmen. The Proofreader (Fang Renyuan) donated three piculs worth of land from Shiji. Vice Director of the Headquarters Bureau (Fang Renzai) donated ten piculs worth of land from Haopu. Their Buddhist relative (?) Zhushan Youlin added in six piculs worth of land from Jingxiang and Hengzheng, and some addi- tional fragments came from there. These lands in total yielded 59 piculs valued at seven strings and 256 cash (7,256 cash). With this the Jianfu (Monastery) first had its lands. This can be seen in the record written by the Prefect of Putian, Lü Chengyou. Formerly, one made offerings to the three generations of the Senior Scribe, the Vice Censor in Chief, and the Senior Official (Fang Tingfan) as well as the founders of the six branches of the lineage in the Dharma Hall. On the anniversaries of the deaths of the Vice Censor in Chief and his wife, and those of the Senior Official and his two wives, prayers were recited for their deliverance (<i>zhuiyan</i>). On the Middle Prime <i>Lanpen pudu </i>ritual there was a collective worship of the ancestors, and the descendants of the six branch ancestors would each come to express their reverence, so there were gathered together several thousand people. From the founding of the (Jianfu) Monastery over three hundred years have passed, but the incense has been lit as though it were only a single day. Later the monastery became slightly run down, and the Lord (Fang) Baomo and Lord (Fang) Zhonghui in succes- sion supported (the monastery) and it flourished once more. By 1260, the monastery was impoverished and the buildings were old, the land tax was urgently demanded and the debt was heavy. The abbot Baoxun could not calculate any way out, and so he considered shifting the blame and fleeing. Lord (Fang) Zhonghui’s son, (Fang) Sicheng regretted that the seven generations of ancestors would no longer receive sacrifices, so he generously took from his private funds to pay off the officials and cancel the debt. After managing affairs for two years, making gradual progress, he renewed the gateways, passageways and halls (of the mon- astery). Then he led his entire lineage in announcing to the (Xinghua) Commandery that “The Commandery has for a long time planned for its own income through its supervision of Buddhist temples. The new abbot of the monastery collects the military aide tax in full, and every ten years he is replaced and the new abbot continues on in the same way. The offi- cials ask how much should go towards military aide, but they never ask whether the monks are corrupt or pure. How then can monasteries not collapse? We request that this monastery be ordered to collect one tenth of the monastic military aide tax each year, and that this amount be paid to the officials on an annual basis (at the start of the year). The abbot should be chosen by the higher officials of my lineage.” He also stated: Monasteries are built up and flourish through renovations, they decline</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 295</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">through expenditures (on taxes). Currently, with the exception of the great anniversaries of the saints, the twice annual taxes, the <i>mianding </i>military tax, the <i>cuxi </i>commercial tax, the <i>kengzhi </i>mining and smelting tax, the rice and wheat surcharges, the <i>chuanjia </i>tax of boats and armor for the military, the <i>lingmao </i>arrow tax, and the ritual tax all must be remitted according to ancient precedent. However, as for all these kinds of unnecessary additional expenses, such as the demands of the Palace Construction Office, and the costs of paying back the Buddhist Superiors for traveling together to examine the monks (?), government agencies give very help little (to cover these expenses), but the smaller Buddhist monasteries are burdened without end. We request that all of these fees be eliminated.” The Commandery agreed with all of these requests, and passed the report on to the relevant sections of the Ministry of Rites. The Ministry of Rites also accepted the recommendations and sent down orders to commandery and district levels. Thereupon it was announced to the extended lineage that “Nanshan (Guanghua) Monastery is a ritual space for the reverencing of the saints. In the days of leisure at the end of the year, the men with official titles (<i>mingshi</i>) of the lineage formed ranks within the Buddha Halls but they did not visit the shrine (of their ancestors). From now on, after assisting with the incense (in the Bud- dhist halls) everyone should also worship in the ancestral shrine to show respect for the good fortune (of the lineage). The Monastery will pro- vide wine and food, as well as providing labor and services. Also, the Lingyin Jinzi tombs formerly restricted incense offerings based on the incomes from sacrificial lands. <i>Mingshi </i>(Officials of rank), <i>Juren </i>(Pro- vincial Graduates), and <i>Jianxuesheng </i>(District Students) mostly did not prepare sacrifices. From now on they should all pay visits to the tombs, and the Monastery will provide wine and food. We invite all to sweep the tombs, but those who have been assigned to office in the capital are exempted from the division of the sacrificial meat.” The members of the lineage expressed their views, stating, “It would be appropriate to write this into a regulatory contract, as we desire that it be maintained for generations to come.”</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">[<span class="s22">方氏入莆始祖]長官嘗欲營精舍以奉先合族而未果</span>, <span class="s22">六子水部員外郎仁逸、秘書少監仁岳、著作郎仁瑞、大理司直仁遜、禮部郎中仁載、正字仁遠</span>, <span class="s22">協力以成父志</span>, <span class="s22">請隙地於官</span>, <span class="s22">買南寺某司業圃以益之</span>,<span class="s22">於是薦福始有院.既共施寶石全莊田三十石種, 又施南箕田七石種、南門田三石種</span>, <span class="s22">秘監也</span>;<span class="s22">施漈上田三石種</span>, <span class="s22">正字也</span>;<span class="s22">施濠浦田十石種</span>, <span class="s22">禮部也</span>;<span class="s22">增景祥横圳田六石種</span>, <span class="s22">僧祖叔住山有麟也</span>;<span class="s22">计種五十九石</span>, <span class="s22">產錢七貫二百六十五文</span>, <span class="s22">於是薦福始有田</span>.<span class="s22">見於莆田令尹呂承佑之記</span>.<span class="s22">舊祠長史、中丞、長官三世及六房始祖於法堂</span>, <span class="s22">遇中丞祖妣、長官祖二妣忌則追嚴</span>, <span class="s22">中元盂蘭則合祭</span>, <span class="s22">六房之後各來瞻敬</span>, <span class="s22">集者幾千人</span>.<span class="s22">自創院逾三百年</span>, <span class="s22">香火如一日</span>, <span class="s22">後稍衰落</span>, <span class="s22">赖寶謨公、忠惠公後先扶持而復振</span>.<span class="s22">至景定庚申</span>, <span class="s22">院貧屋老</span>, <span class="s22">賦急債重</span>, <span class="s22">主僧寶熏計無所出</span>, <span class="s22">將委之而逃</span>.<span class="s22">忠惠子寺丞君憫七祖垂垂廢祀</span>, <span class="s22">慨然出私錢輸官平債</span>, <span class="s22">經理两年</span>,<span class="s22">銖寸累積</span>, <span class="s22">一新門廡殿堂</span>.<span class="s22">迺帥宗族白於郡曰</span>: “<span class="s22">郡計取辦僧刹久矣</span>. <span class="s22">新</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">296 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">住持納助軍錢十分<span class="s13">, </span>滿十年換帖者亦如之<span class="s13">. </span>問助軍多寡<span class="s13">, </span>未嘗問僧汙潔<span class="s13">, </span>刹烏得不壞？願令本院歲納助軍一分<span class="s13">, </span>歲首輸官<span class="s13">, </span>主僧許本宗官高者選舉<span class="s13">.” </span>又曰：<span class="s13">“</span>院以葺理而興<span class="s13">, </span>以科敷而廢<span class="s13">.</span>今後除聖節大禮、二稅、免丁、醋息、坑冶、米麵、船甲、翎毛、知通儀從悉從古例輸送<span class="s13">, </span>惟諸色泛敷<span class="s13">, </span>如修造司需求、賠補僧正偕腳試案等<span class="s13">, </span>官司所濟無幾<span class="s13">, </span>小院被累無窮<span class="s13">, </span>並乞蠲免<span class="s13">.” </span>郡照所陳給據<span class="s13">, </span>仍申漕臺、禮部<span class="s13">, </span>禮部從申<span class="s13">, </span>符下郡縣。迺念於廣族曰<span class="s13">: “</span>南山<span class="s13">, </span>祝聖道場也<span class="s13">.</span>歲满散日<span class="s13">, </span>族之命士有随班佛殿而不詣祠堂者<span class="s13">, </span>自今祝香畢<span class="s13">, </span>並拜祠飲福<span class="s13">, </span>院辦麵飯<span class="s13">, </span>並勞僕夫<span class="s13">.</span>又靈隱金紫墓<span class="s13">, </span>昔拘蒸嘗分数<span class="s13">, </span>命士、舉人、監學生多不預祭<span class="s13">.</span>自今省謁<span class="s13">, </span>院辦酒食<span class="s13">, </span>請眾拜掃<span class="s13">, </span>内赴官入京者免分胙<span class="s13">.” </span>眾議曰：<span class="s13">“</span>宜着為規約<span class="s13">, </span>願世守之<span class="s13">.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The six brothers of the Fang lineage’s second generation were “all offi- cials in the Kingdom of Min”. This shows that the Jianfu Monastery was built during the Five Dynasties. During the Song the Fang were one of the top ranking lineages in Putian, and the Jianfu monastery, with their support, flourished for many years. For these reasons, from the Five Dynasties until the end of the Southern Song, the Fang lineage used the Jianfu Monastery as the site of their collective ancestral wor- ship, a relationship that lasted for over 300 years of “incense offering that seemed to last but a day.” However, the increasing tax burden on the Buddhist monasteries at the end of the Southern Song caused the Jianfu Monastery to near bankruptcy, and it became totally reli- ant upon the aid and supervision of the Fang lineage, thus gradually losing its independence. After this, because of the moving away of the Fang lineage hall, the Nanshan Jianfu monastery no longer existed. In the Ming Wanli (1573–1620) inscription entitled <i>Chongjian Nanshan Jianfuci beiji (Stele record of the restoration of the Jianfu shrine on Nan- shan) </i><span class="s12">重建南山薦福祠碑記 </span>we read:<span class="s9">20</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">According to my research, my ancestors entered Putian over a thousand years ago (lit. sacrificial cycles), and this shrine also has endured for over 800 years. Perusing the records of this commandery, as for those Buddhist monasteries that contain (ancestral) shrines commemorating local elders, the shrines mostly arose on account of the monastery (i.e., got their names from the monasteries in which they were established). Only the Jianfu (Buddhist Monastery) to the west of Nanshan (Guan- ghuasi) got its name from the ancestral shrine of my ancestors. The</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">victorious dynasty’s soldiers burnt down the monastery, and only ruins were left.

Thereupon materials were gathered and work begun, with construction commencing in the winter of <i>xuyin </i>(1639) and the hall was completed in the autumn of <i>xinsi </i>(1641) We worried that materials and effort would not be ade-</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">quate, so we did not plan to immediately restore the former aspect of the monastery.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">考吾宗入莆千祀<span class="s13">, </span>而是祠亦八百餘年矣<span class="s13">.</span>載觀郡中梵刹之有鄉先生祠<span class="s13">,</span>多緣寺而起<span class="s13">, </span>獨南山迤西之薦福<span class="s13">, </span>則因吾祠而名.⋯勝國兵燹<span class="s13">, </span>洊罹板蕩<span class="s13">.</span>皇朝洪武丙子<span class="s13">, </span>移建追遠堂於古棠巷中<span class="s13">, </span>此地寖鞠萊草薌<span class="s13">.</span>給諫萬有公叙譜<span class="s13">, </span>曾致慨之<span class="s13">.</span>尚祖際萬歷庚戌<span class="s13">, </span>徧覆圭田<span class="s13">, </span>力清出故址<span class="s13">. </span>⋯於是飭材鳩工<span class="s13">, </span>徵役於戊寅冬<span class="s13">, </span>吿成於辛巳秋<span class="s13">.</span>⋯虞物力之未副<span class="s13">, </span>不圖頓還舊觀<span class="s13">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In the eyes of the Fang lineage of the Ming period, it would seem that the Jianfu monastery had been built originally exclusively in order to serve as the lineage hall of the Fang. Thus after the moving away of the Fang ancestral hall in the Ming, there was no longer any reason for the continued existence of the Jianfu Monastery. Even though a Fang lineage ancestral hall was built on this site in the Ming Wanli period, there was “no plan to restore the original aspect” of the site. In other words, the lineage hall had by then entirely replaced the Bud- dhist monastery.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">During the Ming Qing period, there were still some Putian lineages who maintained ancestral halls within Buddhist monasteries but these halls were usually separately managed by the lineages themselves, so that the relations between monasteries and lineages had completely reversed itself. For example, the <i>Yanshou Xu lineage genealogy </i><span class="s12">延壽徐氏族譜 </span>compiled at the end of the Qing states:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">The Jingxiang shrine is to the northwest of the Prefectural city (of Putian) close by the old ancestral residence in the Yanshou area. In</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">the Tang Lord Zhongmi donated funds to construct the Jingxiang Mon- astery, and donated over seven <i>qing </i>of land to cover the costs of incense and lamps. By the Song, Lord Duo, the Dakui (first place) Prime Min- ister once more restored the monastery and donated an additional two qing of land. The monks were moved by his virtue, and built a shrine to worship the two lords as Patrons. The temple plaque read “The shrine of the Two First Place Candidates from the Tang and the Song”. Following this, imperially honored Lord Chaofeng, whose name was Zhefu, and Lord Chongyi, whose name was Kezhen, each in succession repaired the shrine At the beginning of the Qing, the shrine had once again col-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">298 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">lapsed, and the monastery monks built up a simple earthen walled struc- ture, in which the images of the former ancestors were placed on the second floor. In Kangxi <i>dingyou </i>(1717), Gentleman Lord Wanan of the Xianxi branch, together with the Putian lineage members Chengzhang, Feiying, and Lianghan tore down the earthen structure and urged the entire lineage to rebuild. In Qianlong <i>gengchen </i>(1760), in the autumn, the Xianxi branch paid a visit to the shrine, and found it narrow and small, and so with (the help of) the nephews Daren, Daye, Darui, and Dayuan, they added on a back hall to the shrine . . . They also recalled that the monastery had first been built by their founding ancestor, but that over time it had collapsed. So they contributed funds and rebuilt the monastery anew.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">景祥祠<span class="s13">, </span>在郡城西北<span class="s13">, </span>⋯密邇故居延壽地<span class="s13">.</span>唐中秘公捐資創景祥寺<span class="s13">, </span>仍舍田七餘頃<span class="s13">, </span>以充香燈需<span class="s13">.</span>至宋<span class="s13">, </span>大魁尚書鐸公複整本寺<span class="s13">, </span>增租二頃<span class="s13">.</span>僧德之<span class="s13">, </span>立祠祀二公為檀越主<span class="s13">, </span>榜曰 <span class="s13">“</span>唐宋二狀元祠<span class="s13">”.</span>嗣是<span class="s13">, </span>朝奉公哲甫、崇儀公可珍疊加修葺<span class="s13">.</span>⋯國朝初年<span class="s13">, </span>本祠復圮<span class="s13">, </span>寺僧潛築土樓<span class="s13">, </span>只存先影於樓上<span class="s13">.</span>康熙丁酉歲<span class="s13">, </span>仙溪房朝議大夫萬安公與莆諸生成章、蜚英、良翰輩<span class="s13">, </span>削平寨樓<span class="s13">, </span>倡族復重建之<span class="s13">. </span>乾隆庚辰秋<span class="s13">, </span>仙溪臨謁本祠<span class="s13">,</span>見規模狹隘<span class="s13">, </span>與侄大任、大業、大瑞、大源添盖本祠後座<span class="s13">.</span>⋯又念本寺為世祖創建之地<span class="s13">, </span>日久傾頹<span class="s13">, </span>因為之捐資鼎建重新云<span class="s13">.</span><span class="s19">21</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Even though both the Jingxiang Monastery and the Jingxiang ancestral hall both exist, nevertheless the Xu lineage strictly conceived of them- selves as the owners of the establishment, and the monks are only the employees of the Xu lineage. This kind of inversion of guest into host can be seen in incipient form already in the Song to Yuan transitional period. In the <i>Chongxiu Jingxiang xushi citangji (Record of the restora- tion of the Jingxiang Xu lineage ancestral hall) </i><span class="s12">重 修 景 祥 徐 氏 祠 堂 記 </span>of 1346, the author proclaims:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">According to my research, families having a temple and sacrifices hav- ing lands (to pay for them) is an ancient rule. In recent generations, the great households have bequeathed lands to create monasteries, put- ting themselves in charge of the shrine to the patrons. Although this is not an ancient rule, nevertheless it began as a way of repaying (the debt to) one’s origins (one’s ancestors) so that they would shine on and not be forgotten, thus this is one (with the ancient ways) . . . In the Song, taxes were taken from the monasteries, and the Jingxiang (hall) was not maintained. Only the Buddha hall and the shrine to (Xu Yin <span class="s22">徐 寅 </span>) were maintained.

Before long, the Buddhist monk Yuangui did not take proper care of the incense offerings, and claimed the moun- tain around the tombs as his own property. The high official Imperially enfeoffed Lord (Xu) Jifu took the (land) certificate as proof, and then the matter was cleared up. After this the Buddhist Hall collapsed, and only the Dharma hall and the shrine (to Xu Yin) were left. The males of my preceding generation, and those of my own generation, from within my lineage branch, all felt a great sense of loss, stating that the family fabric was very ancient, and that it would be appropriate to renew the family temple. They considered the fact that our lineage has many descendants, and that sacrificial lands must not be too plain. Thereupon the ancestral portraits were repainted, and new sacrificial lands were established, so that the great accomplishments of our ancestors over hundreds of years could again be seen in this day and age.

What is significant is that in order to find a theoretical support for their actions, the Xu lineage members struggled to equate the Shrine of the Patron inside the monastery with a <span class="s12">家 廟 </span>(a Fam- ily Temple.) This demonstrates that the struggle between lineage and Buddhist monasteries in the Song Yuan period was at heart a struggle between Buddhism and Confucian ideas.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Historically, the Buddhist monasteries in Putian provided an official</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">cover for the development of lineages and their practices of ancestral worship, and as a result these establishments received considerable support from the great lineages.

Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism took form during the transition from the Northern to the Southern Song, and in the Southern Song Fujian was the center of transmission, and this had a profound impact on the literati of Putian. Neo-Confucian teachers such as the Putian scholar Lin Guangchao played an important role in the transmission of these ideas. Lin Guangchao, personal name Qianzhi, sobriquet Aixuan<span class="s12">林光朝字謙之</span>, <span class="s12">號艾軒</span>, roamed in his youth in Henan, and took as his teachers the masters of the Luo teachings. Later he returned to his home in Putian and dedicated himself to teaching, building the Hongquan (Red Stream) Academy <span class="s12">红泉書院</span>, where he is credited with establishing the Red Stream school of Neo-Confucian thought. In 1182, Putian scholars requested the construction of an Aixuan Shrine<span class="s12">艾軒祠堂</span>, stating in their dedicatory inscriptions</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Although Putian is but a small pile of stones, its Confucian style is especially flourishing. For forty or fifty years since the Shaoxing period (1131–1162), the scholars have known the Luo Teachings (of Cheng Yi) and have been renowned throughout the land for their cultivated attain- ments in the performance of righteousness. Master Lin Aixuan truly made this happen. The Master made a thorough study of the Six Clas- sics, and on the side worked through the hundred philosophers. Early on he traveled to Shangxiang (i.e., various academies), but he recalled his kin and returned to his home village, where he opened a school and transmitted his teachings. Scholars from all directions came to study with him. Every year he taught several hundred people and those that obtained outstanding results in the examinations and rose to become prominent scholars were very numerous. The Master’s way of being was to set a standard with his own conduct, to take the Way and Virtue as his chariot, and he did not only take the composition of essays and documents as his main purpose. As for his movements and rest, and his speech and response to questions, he always was led by ritual and per- formed righteousness. He so transformed scholars that when they would travel around the district and the city, their clothes and hat would always be in order, and they had the air of one who could do no wrong. Even if people did not recognize them, they would know that they were the students of Master Aixuan. How could it be (thought) that there was no source for this transformation of the style of the scholars of Putian?</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">莆雖小壘<span class="s13">, </span>儒風特盛<span class="s13">.</span>自紹興以來四五十年<span class="s13">, </span>士知洛學而以行義修飾聞於鄉里者<span class="s13">, </span>艾軒林先生實作成之也<span class="s13">.</span>先生學通六經<span class="s13">, </span>旁貫百氏<span class="s13">.</span>早遊上庠<span class="s13">, </span>已而思親還里<span class="s13">, </span>開門教授<span class="s13">.</span>四方之士摳衣從學者<span class="s13">, </span>歲率數百人<span class="s13">, </span>其取</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 301</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">巍科、登顯仕甚眾<span class="s13">.</span>先生之為人<span class="s13">, </span>以身為律<span class="s13">, </span>以道德為權輿<span class="s13">, </span>不專習詞章為進取計也<span class="s13">.</span>其出入起居、語言問對<span class="s13">, </span>無非率禮蹈義<span class="s13">.</span>士者化之<span class="s13">, </span>間有經行井邑<span class="s13">, </span>而衣冠肅然<span class="s13">, </span>有不可犯之色<span class="s13">.</span>人雖不識<span class="s13">, </span>望之知其為艾軒弟子也<span class="s13">.</span>莆之士風一變<span class="s13">, </span>豈無所自<span class="s13">?</span><span class="s19">23</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Lin Guangchao was succeeded by his disciples Lin Yizhi <span class="s12">林亦之 </span>(sobriquet Wangshan <span class="s12">網山</span>), Chen Zao <span class="s12">陳藻 </span>(sobriquet Lexuan <span class="s12">樂軒</span>) who in succession led the Red Stream Academy. They were also renowned Fujianese Neo-Confucian thinkers of the Southern Song. In 1244, Chen Zao’s student Lin Xiyi <span class="s12">林希逸 </span>requested that the Fujian Commander built a Chengshan Sanxianshengci <span class="s12">城山三先生祠 </span>(Shrine to the Three Gentlemen of Chengshan), stating:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">The School of the Three Masters (began) after the southern relocation (of the court to Hangzhou) (at the point when) Zhou (Dunyi) and the Cheng (brothers) had passed away and before Zhu (Xi) and Zhang (Zai) had emerged. Master Aixuan spread the (study of the) Classics and the putting into practice (of the teachings of the Classics) throughout the Southeast. He caused the many scholars to be immersed (in these teach- ings) and to embody the teachings in their daily practice. The realiza- tion that the Way of Heaven did not reside in philological study began with Master Aixuan. Masters Wangshan and Lexuan helped scholars to begin to suspect that the Luo School did not delight in (emphasize) writ- ing, and that the Han Confucians had not reached to (the essence of) human nature and destiny. They caused all the scholars to merge (these approaches) together and see through (to the essence). The realization that human nature and the Way of Heaven were only to be found in written texts (of the Classics) began with Wangshan and Lexuan. Wang- shan’s writings were extremely similar to those of Master Aixuan, so that even the most familiar could not differentiate them. Lexuan was more grand. In their guarding of the Way, they very severely drove off hetero- dox views. Once they inscribed (an epitaph?) stating, “After Buddhism entered the Central Plains the sacrifices and rites were neglected. Foreign monks played music while the bereft children busied themselves (with Buddhist rites).” The people of this region were transformed. If people took the teachings of Wangshan and Lexuan and applied them to this day and age, how could what be attained be less than what Lexuan had achieved?</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">三先生之學<span class="s13">, </span>自南渡後<span class="s13">.</span>周、程中歇<span class="s13">, </span>朱、張未起<span class="s13">, </span>以經行倡東南<span class="s13">, </span>使諸生涵泳體踐<span class="s13">, </span>知聖賢之心不在於訓詁者<span class="s13">, </span>自艾軒始<span class="s13">.</span>疑洛學不好文詞<span class="s13">, </span>漢儒未達性命<span class="s13">, </span>使諸生融液通貫<span class="s13">, </span>知性與天道不在文章之外者<span class="s13">, </span>自網山、樂軒始<span class="s13">.</span>蓋網山論著酷似艾軒<span class="s13">, </span>雖精識不能辨<span class="s13">;</span>樂軒加雄放焉<span class="s13">.</span>其</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_165.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">23 </span>(Song) Chen Junqing (<span class="s16">宋</span>) <span class="s16">陳俊卿</span>, “Aixuan citang ji <span class="s16">艾軒祠堂記</span>”, in Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 26, pp. 28–29.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">302 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">衛吾道、闢異端甚嚴<span class="s13">, </span>嘗銘某人云<span class="s13">: “</span>佛入中原祭禮荒<span class="s13">, </span>胡僧奏樂孤子忙<span class="s13">.” </span>里人化之<span class="s13">.</span>使網山、樂軒而用於世<span class="s13">, </span>所立豈在樂軒下哉<span class="s13">!</span><span class="s19">24</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">As stated above, the Red Stream School played an important role in the transmission of Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism from elite to lower levels of society, and this school was involved in continuous innova- tions. Lin Guangchao’s teaching took place prior to Zhu Xi, who was a contemporary of Lin’s students Lin Yizhi and Chen Cao, and who all worked from common sources and saw themselves as fellow stu- dents. However, due to the emphasis placed on oral elucidation rather than on written exegesis, the Red Stream School’s influence on later generations cannot compare with that of Zhu Xi. In the latter part of the Southern Song, Zhu Xi’s fame grew by the day, and he had con- siderable influence on Putian as well. In Jiading 13 (1220), the Putian Confucian school established a Shrine to Master of Literature Zhu(Xi), and Zhu’s close disciple Chen Mi <span class="s12">陳宓 </span>composed the inscription:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Master (Zhu Xi) composed dozens of texts. Amongst these the ones that are most effective in teaching each age include his (edition and commen- tary) to the <i>Great Learning</i>, <i>Doctrine of the Mean with Interlinear Com- mentary</i>, the <i>Analects</i>, <i>Mencius with Collected Commentaries, Record of Things Close at Hand</i>, <i>Family Ritual</i>, and <i>Minor Teachings</i>. Families transmit these texts and people recite them aloud. Although Putian is a very small city, in the past it was known as the homeland of the scholars. Master (Zhu Xi) first served in office in Quanzhou, and visited Putian three times during the Chunxi period (1174–1189). There were many scholars who were attracted by his teachings and carried them onwards. Twenty-two years after Master (Zhu Xi) passed away, those of his gen- eration still felt great remorse, while those born afterwards increasingly knew to show him their admiration.

This can be described as a process of the popularization of the theory and practice of ancestral worship.<span class="s9">26 </span>This was because Cheng-Zhu neo-Confucian- ism emphasized the teaching of ritual and ritual orders, hoping by means of reforms to sacrifice and ritual to bring about “respect for one’s ancestors and the unification of the lineage” “<span class="s12">敬宗收族</span>”. Cheng Yi thought that “from the Emperor to the commoner, the five degrees of mourning are the same, and sacrificial practice should also be simi- lar “<span class="s12">天子至於庶人</span>, <span class="s12">五服不異</span>, <span class="s12">祭亦如之</span>.” Because of this view, he advocated the elimination of the hierarchical system of differing levels of sacrificial rites of worship of the ancestors, thereby enabling aris- tocrats and commoners alike to worship and sacrifice to all of their ancestors within the past five generations. He also recommended that even though both the founder of the lineage <span class="s12">高祖 </span>and the regional ancestral founder <span class="s12">始祖 </span>were likely to be outside the limits of the five generational rule, they should be sacrificed to once a year, in order to show respect for one’s origins.<span class="s9">27  </span>On this basis, Zhu Xi put forward the further suggestion “when a gentleman sets up a residence, he should first erect a shrine to the east of the main chamber, and make four niches in order to worship the former ancestors”. The “ancestral shrine” he designed could be used to simultaneously worship and sacrifice to the last four generations descended from the founding ancestor. This actually extended the <span class="s12">小宗 </span>(<i>xiaozong</i>) [classical minor descent line ancestral worship form] to the common people. As for sacrificing to the regional founding ancestor and other ancestors above the past four generations, Zhu Xi thought “these two sacrifices were not ritual prac- tices of antiquity, but Yinchuan (proposed them) on account of their [intrinsic] meaningfulness, and I feel that one can therefore overstep</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_167.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">25 </span>(Song) Chen Mi (<span class="s16">宋</span>) <span class="s16">陳宓</span>, “Zhuwengong ciji <span class="s16">朱文公祠記</span>” Dean and Zheng,</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Epigraphical Materials<span class="s7">, 1995: No. 31, p. 34.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">26 </span>Zheng Zhenman, <i>Family Lineage Organization and Social Change in Ming and Qing Fujian</i>, trans.

However, because Song Confucians placed a great deal of emphasis on the difference between Great and Minor Ancestral lines, this also had a negative effect on the development of lineage organization. Therefore, in the post Song process of the development of lineage forms there were continuous reforms and innovations with regards to ancestral worship and sacrifice.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In Song Putian there were already some Family Temples and Shrines</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">set up exclusively for sacrificing to the ancestors, but because these were limited in the number of generations to which they could offer sacrifices, these proved difficult to continuously function and develop. In Qingyuan 2 (1196), Zhu Xi <span class="s12">朱熹 </span>composed his <i>Tangguizhou cishi fengkaiguogong shizhongyi Huanggong citangji </i><span class="s12">唐桂州刺史封開國公謚忠義黃公祠堂記</span>, and stated:<span class="s9">29</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">In the (Tang) Minghuang period (712–756) the Guizhou Prefect, Lord of Loyalty and Righteousness (Huang) An, together with his son (Huang) Yao served as District Magistrates in Fujian.

(Huang Wenhui’s) grandson (Huang) Shigui, Director of Studies in the National University, who was honored with (the prestige title of) Grand Master for Court Discussion, in 1032 ordered the construction of the hall and announced its name as the Huangshi Citang (Huang Lineage Ancestral hall). He set up sacrificial lands to provide for the costs of sacrificial rites, but passed away before this was completed. (Huang) Shigui’s grandson, (Huang) Yanhui had served as Controller-general of Chaozhou. He donated his salary and renewed the hall. The hall is in front, and the mausoleum is behind it, clearly illustrating proper relationships. The ancestral tablets (zhaomu) are arranged by rank, and all is in good order. In spring and autumn sacrifices, the fragrance of the offerings rise up, and all are rev- erent and timely (quoting from <i>Book of Songs </i>No. 199). Thus they fol- lowed the practices of Master Sima (Guang) and the ideas concerning the Family Temple of Master Ouyang (Xiu). Thus, as for this Ancestral hall being built, the great acts of these three Gentlemen were magnificent indeed! I have had occasion to reflect on this. For ages we have been troubled by the absence of ancestral halls, and when there were ancestral halls, they would be built in one generation, and then most would disap- pear within the following generation. Alas! This is truly lamentable. Now as for something like the construction and maintenance of the Huang Lineage Ancestral hall over several generations, this is something that has been difficult for the <i>shidafu </i>(learned elite) families (to accomplish). Moreover (I) Zhu Xi have something else to say. When the person who builds (an ancestral hall) is our own ancestor, then how can those of later generations not think on their ancestor? Now thinking of (one’s ancestor) consists in nothing other than repairing the ancestral temple (zumiao), participating in rites on the first and the fifteenth day of the month, offering seasonal foods (to the ancestors), making sacrifices on the dates of the deaths (of the ancestors). This can be called having end- less progeny, with sincerity and harmoniousness transmitted forever.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">[<span class="s22">唐</span>]<span class="s22">明皇時</span>, <span class="s22">桂州刺史忠義公岸偕其子謠為閩縣令</span>, <span class="s22">始遷於莆涵江黃巷居焉</span>.<span class="s22">刺史六世孫校書郎偕其孫奉禮郎文惠</span>, <span class="s22">孝心克篤</span>, <span class="s22">爰構家廟</span>, <span class="s22">未既而卒</span>.<span class="s22">其孫世規以國子司業赠朝議大夫</span>, <span class="s22">於明道元年命工營建</span>, <span class="s22">榜曰 </span>“<span class="s22">黃氏祠堂</span>”, <span class="s22">定祭田以供祀典</span>, <span class="s22">未備複卒</span>.<span class="s22">世規孫彥輝歴官潮州通判</span>,<span class="s22">捐俸新之</span>.<span class="s22">前堂後寢</span>, <span class="s22">煥然有倫</span>;<span class="s22">昭穆尊卑</span>, <span class="s22">秩然有序</span>;<span class="s22">禴祀蒸嘗</span>, <span class="s22">孔惠孔時</span>;<span class="s22">蓋有效於司馬君實、歐陽永叔氏家廟之意也</span>.<span class="s22">則是祠堂之所由立者</span>, <span class="s22">三公厥功偉哉！然嘗伏思之</span>, <span class="s22">世患無祠堂耳</span>, <span class="s22">而世之有者</span>, <span class="s22">創於一世</span>, <span class="s22">不二世淪沒者多矣</span>.<span class="s22">嗚呼！良可悲也</span>.<span class="s22">如黃氏祠堂而創續於祖孫若是</span>, <span class="s22">此士大夫家孫子之所難也</span>.<span class="s22">然熹又有說焉</span>.<span class="s22">創之者爾祖耳</span>, <span class="s22">後之人可無念爾祖乎？然念之者無他</span>, <span class="s22">祖廟修</span>, <span class="s22">朔望參</span>, <span class="s22">時食薦</span>, <span class="s22">辰忌祭</span>;<span class="s22">雲礽千億</span>, <span class="s22">敦睦相傳於不朽云</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The Huang lineage had built their “Family Temple” starting in their sixth generation (within Putian), and in their tenth generation they built an ancestral hall, which only attained its complete form in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">306 zheng zhenman</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">twelfth generation. This process lasted over six generations. Zhu Xi was deeply moved by these developments, noting that not only was it difficult at that time to build an ancestral hall, but that it was difficult to maintain such a hall long after it was built. In his comments, Zhu Xi does not provide an in depth analysis of the reasons for the ances- tral hall’s difficulty in maintaining stable development. He merely expresses the hope that through ancestral worship and rites of sacrifice the sense of unity of the lineage as a whole will be strengthened. In fact, the fundamental reason for the difficulty in sustaining continuous development for the Song lineage was their inability to worship ances- tors beyond the fourth generation. Only by breaking through these limitations on the number of generations to whom one could sacrifice would it be possible to ensure the long term stable development of the lineage hall. What is noteworthy is that the Huang lineage ances- tral hall worshipped and sacrificed to the founding Putian ancestor at twelve generations remove. This did not concur with contemporary ritual regulations, nor did it concur with the demands of the <i>Zhuzi jiali </i><span class="s12">朱子家禮 </span>(<i>Family Rituals of Master Zhu </i>(<i>Xi</i>)). Nevertheless, Zhu Xi does not express any concern over this point in the inscription. Earlier scholars have debated whether the <i>Family Ritual </i>was actually composed by Zhu Xi, or whether it had been substantially modified by later editors. Perhaps the view that the ancestral shrine must be restricted to the minor lineage formation was not Zhu Xi’s underlying view after all?<span class="s9">30</span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In the Song-Yuan transition, due to the spreading influence of the</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;"><i>Zhuzi Jiali </i><span class="s12">朱子家禮</span>, the building of ancestral shrines by the scholar gentry elite became a widespread phenomenon.

Together with over ten like-minded scholars, he met in Master Chen’s Yangzhi Hall where scripture exposition was held once every ten days.

Therefore, the sacrifice to distant ances- tors found amongst these Huang kinsmen was probably the common model for ancestral halls in Putian at that time.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In the early Ming, the scholar gentry of Putian all considered the Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucian thought as the orthodox form of Confu- cianism, but they nonetheless held very distinctive views of the ritu- als of sacrifice to the ancestors, and held continuous ongoing debates around the topic of regulations concerning ancestral halls. In Hongzhi (1489), the Minister of Punishments Peng Shao <span class="s12">彭韶 </span>in his <i>Baitang Lishi chongxiu xianci bei </i>(<i>Stele on the repairs to the shrine of former (ancestors) of the Li lineage of Baitang</i>) <span class="s12">白塘李氏重修先祠碑 </span>pointed out:<span class="s9">34</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">I have heard it said that ritual has more than one form and that human feelings are endless. If the descendant does not know his ancestor, that is the end of the matter. But if he knows his ancestor, how can he be casual about this (fact). Formerly, Master Cheng (Yi) once sacrificed to his founding ancestor as well as his immediate ancestors. Master Ziyang (Zhu Xi) followed him in this and wrote his <i>Family Rituals</i>. Later I suspect he was uneasy and stopped (his writing?) In the early years of the Hongwu period of Emperor Taizu (r. 1368–1398), it was permissible for officials and commoners to sacrifice to their great-grandfather, their grandfather, and their deceased father. In the Yongle reign period (1403–1424) the <i>Xingli dachun </i>was edited, and the <i>Family Rituals </i>were spread through- out the empire. Thereupon worship of the distant ancestor became the common rule. However, one could set out spirit tablets but not build a specialized (separate standing) shrine (for their worship). Nowadays, the renowned lineages of Putian mostly all have (such shrines), and in the arrangement of the generations within the ancestral niche-altars each family makes its own order. Some divide them into five niches, with their great-grandfathers, grandfathers, and those under them to left and right. Some lineages also divide them into five niches, and their descen- dants worship their own ancestors from the great-grandfather on down on the left and right in accordance with their lineage branches. All wor- ship their earlier ancestors in the central niche. Others in accordance with the <i>Book of Rites </i>divide it up into four generations per niche, with the westernmost being the highest ancestor, while the early ancestor is only worshipped at the gravesite. But people question this. Old Confu- cian scholars of the Rites have reached the point where there is no fixed opinion. Truly if one bases everything on people’s utmost feelings, it will</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_172.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">34 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 103, pp. 116–118.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">310 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">be impossible to bring (this debate) to an end, and impossible to achieve unanimity. Now the shrine in Baishuitang worships upwards of over ten generations. Based on our research into the meaning of the <i>Rites</i>, this seems to be improper. However, the kin of the lineage are so numerous and dispersed, that if we abandoned (these rites) and did not carry them out, then people would feel lost and abandoned at heart, with nothing left to tie them together. Wishing to preserve ancestral worship, without letting it decline, and (thereby) to link together the blessing of the lin- eage for eternity, is this not difficult! Alas!

However, because neither Cheng Yi nor Zhu Xi had advocated the establishment of “stand alone spe- cialized shrines for the worship and sacrifice to distant ancestors”, this was still a matter of considerable difficulty to contemporary Confucian scholars deeply concerned with ritual propriety. Amongst the popular practices of sacrificing to the ancestors in Putian the vast majority of lineages had already established ancestral halls dedicated to the sacri- ficial worship of their distant ancestors. Thus the regulations concern- ing lineage worship and sacrifice in the <i>Zhuzi jiali </i>had long ago been surpassed. In Peng Shao’s view, although the worship of and sacrifice to distant ancestors in lineage halls contravened the ritual regulations, nevertheless it was of utmost importance in maintaining the solidarity of the lineages. Therefore he felt it was not necessary to get bogged down in ritual regulations, and he advocated the construction of lin- eage halls dedicated to the worship of distant ancestors.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: right;">Another major innovation in sacrificial rituals of ancestral worship</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">during the Ming in Putian was the overcoming of the supreme con-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 311</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">trol over sacrificial rituals of the <i>zongzi </i>(the eldest son of the main descent line of the lineage). In ancient Chinese lineage regulations, the rights of inheritance were controlled by the eldest son of the main descent line, and only the son who had inherited the line was entitled to conduct sacrifices to the ancestors. In the rituals of sacrifice to the ancestors established by Zhu Xi, it is also the eldest son who is the chief sacrificer. This kind of exclusive right of inheritance is obviously unsuited to the broad spread of sacrifices to the ancestors amongst the common people, and it was in fact unable to spread widely. In Cheng- hua 19 (1483) the Confucian scholar Huang Zhongzhao <span class="s12">黃仲昭 </span>in his <i>Hemai linshi citang ji (Record of the Hemei Lin lineage ancestral hall</i>)<span class="s12">和美林氏祠堂記 </span>stated:<span class="s9">35</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Uncle Wenfu reflected on the meaning of the origins of water and wood, sincerely seeking to return to (the ways of) antiquity and to the (power of the) origins. Thereupon he built an ancestral hall. With the start- ing point beginning with his highest ancestor, the remaining ancestors (spirit tablets) were arranged and worshipped according to the zhaomu system. Because of our connections, he asked (me, Huang) Zhongzhao to make a record of the hall, saying, “The ancestral hall was fortunately temporarily completed, and yet I still find some great deficiencies (in my actions), but I do not know what to do about it. When my father passed away I was only six years old. My uncles and cousins were poor and moved about, and the old residences of our ancestors all fell into the hands of other lineages First we bought a chamber with several</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">columns on the east of Hemei street, in order to reverence our ancestors</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">and to assist with the plans of our kin. Then, depending on the ongo- ing blessings of our ancestors, our family grew more abundant. Then we moved to the west side of Hemei Street, and converted the former residence into an ancestral hall. This is where we have recently built. Now according to the regulations for the ancestral halls of antiquity, the rites must be presided over by the eldest descendant of the main line. Nowadays, the main descent line of my lineage is unreliable, and those directly descended or closely related to the main line have all moved far away, so that it is inconvenient for them to take part in sacrifices, nor is this what they could stand. These rites of offerings and remem- brance were all presided over by myself. In comparison with the Rites, these practices still lacked something to make them harmonious. This is the great deficiency that my heart feels. Fortunately your record will detail these ideas, in order thereby that gentlemen who love the Rites will understand why I have taken this position. It was because there was no alternative.” I (Huang Zhongzhao) maintain that the ancient ancestors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_173.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">35 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: no. 97, pp. 109–110.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">312 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">and saintly kings followed human feeling in regulating ritual (conduct), and that therefore ritual has the means to control and adorn human feel- ings. If a gentleman’s reflections on ritual do not negate human feelings, then even if they do not accord with antiquity, still they will not harm his conducting ritual actions. If Uncle Wenfu, upon having encountered this (difficulty), had had to follow every regulation in an effort to accord with antiquity, then the rites for his ancestors and his kin would have had nothing to base themselves on. How could that provide any peace to human feelings? The rites of the ancient kings indeed included cases in which there was no alternative and one had to be flexible and adapt to circumstances. Now in the situation in which Uncle Wenfu found himself, can this not also be called a matter of being flexible in regards to ritual?</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">叔文甫念水木本源之義<span class="s13">, </span>篤反古復始之心<span class="s13">, </span>爰創祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>斷自高祖<span class="s13">, </span>以下昭穆而祀之<span class="s13">, </span>因屬仲昭為之記。且曰：<span class="s13">“</span>祠幸苟完<span class="s13">, </span>而吾猶有所大闕焉<span class="s13">, </span>然未如之何也<span class="s13">.</span>先君違世時<span class="s13">, </span>吾方六歲<span class="s13">, </span>世父及伯兄貧窮轉徙<span class="s13">, </span>先世舊廬皆入於他姓。 ⋯始買屋數楹於和美街東<span class="s13">, </span>為奉先事親之計<span class="s13">, </span>既而賴祖宗余慶<span class="s13">, </span>家以益裕<span class="s13">, </span>遂徙居於和美街西<span class="s13">, </span>而以舊所居為祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>即今所創者是也。然古祠堂之制<span class="s13">, </span>必主於宗子。今吾大宗既無所考<span class="s13">, </span>而繼祖、繼禰之宗又皆播遷闊遠<span class="s13">, </span>於奉祭不便<span class="s13">, </span>且非其所堪也。肆凡饗荐裸奠之儀<span class="s13">, </span>皆吾自主之<span class="s13">, </span>揆之於禮有所未協<span class="s13">, </span>此則吾心所大闕者。記幸詳此意<span class="s13">, </span>俾愛禮君子知吾所以處此<span class="s13">, </span>蓋未如之何也。<span class="s13">” </span>某竊惟古先聖王緣人情以制禮<span class="s13">, </span>則夫禮者所以節文乎人情者也。君子之酌乎禮<span class="s13">,</span>苟於人情無所咈<span class="s13">, </span>則雖不合於古<span class="s13">, </span>亦不害其為禮矣。叔文甫之所遭如此<span class="s13">, </span>若必欲規規以求合於禮<span class="s13">, </span>則祖、禰之祀皆無所托<span class="s13">, </span>其於人情安乎？先王之禮<span class="s13">, </span>固有不得已而用權者。若叔文甫之處此<span class="s13">, </span>其亦所謂禮之權者歟<span class="s13">?</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">The founder and main sacrificer of the Lin lineage ancestral hall both were not the first born sons of the main line of the lineage, but Huang Zhongzhao did not consider this problematic. In his view, ritual must accord with human feelings, thus it is capable of changing: given that there is a contradiction between the rules regarding the main descent line and real social needs, there is no need to insist on following the regulations. Another contemporary Confucian scholar of Huang Zhongzhao named Zhou Ying also took a position in support of trans- forming authority to achieve changes. In his </span>Shengdun Wushi xinjian citangji <span class="s12">聖墩ª氏新建祠堂記 </span>(Record of the new construction of the Shengdun Wu lineage ancestral hall)<span class="p">:</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">The Wu lineage has long lived in Ketang. The Seventh Generation Ances- tor, Commandery Governor (?) Niansi had moved to Shengdun . . . After four generations (his line) reached Lord (Wu) Zhongyun, who had five sons, each of which established a branch of the lineage. The eldest son was named Guangyi, cognomen Dun’an, who unreservedly devoted</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 313</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">his thoughts to ritual. He suggested building an ancestral hall. But he stopped before he could complete the purchasing of the land. He raised up his eyes and said to (Wu) Chaoqi, “You must work at this.” Chaoqi was moved to immediately continue (the work), but those who discussed the (proper) ritual regulations stated that a branch son could not build an ancestral hall. For this reason he hesitated for a long time. Then, fear- ing that there was no one to continue his ancestor’s plan, each year he divided off some fertile land and repeatedly collected rents from these lands in order to sacrifice to his ancestral kin in his private chambers. Now he has grown old (he) used stone and wood gathered by his pre-</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">decessors and raised more supplies. He built an ancestral hall to the southwest of his former residence, on some convenient land. According to the Rites, from the <i>biezi </i>(all the other sons besides the eldest) on down, there are those who continued the line of the highest ancestor, those who continued the line of the great-grandfather, those who con- tinued the line of the grandfather, and all those who continue the line of the deceased parent. These four lines of transmission are at the origin of the ancestral system. Each of the four lines had their separate temple, and each was led in ritual sacrifice by their own main descent line son. When there were (ritual) activities in the temples, each line’s people would each go to their respective places Now as for the building of</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">an ancestral hall, this can only be done if one has adequate funding and ability. If the main descent line son cannot build it, it is permissible for the other sons to build it. The other sons can build the ancestral hall, then either the main descent line son can lead the sacrifice, or if the main descent line son has some difficulties, then the other sons can lead the ritual sacrifices. On the basis of the Rites, there is nothing unacceptable (about this).</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">ª氏舊居可塘<span class="s13">, </span>七世祖念四府君徙聖墩。⋯⋯四傳至仲允公<span class="s13">, </span>生五子<span class="s13">,</span>分為五房。其長曰光益<span class="s13">, </span>號遯菴<span class="s13">, </span>慨然以尚禮為念<span class="s13">, </span>建議立祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>蓋以購地未就而止。⋯⋯因舉矚目朝器曰：<span class="s13">“</span>汝必勉之。<span class="s13">” </span>朝器感激立繼<span class="s13">,</span>而議禮者謂支子不得立祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>用是遲迴者久之。又恐無繼先志<span class="s13">, </span>歲惟割腴田若干<span class="s13">, </span>俾迭收租<span class="s13">, </span>而祀宗親於私室。今老矣<span class="s13">, </span>⋯即先世所蓄木石而增益之, 建祠堂於祖居西南<span class="s13">, </span>叢便地也。按禮<span class="s13">, </span>别子而下<span class="s13">, </span>有繼高祖之宗<span class="s13">, </span>繼曾祖之宗<span class="s13">, </span>繼祖之宗<span class="s13">, </span>繼禰之宗。此四宗者<span class="s13">, </span>宗法所自起也。四宗自各為廟<span class="s13">, </span>各以宗子主其祭。有事於廟<span class="s13">, </span>則宗人各以其屬從。⋯⋯若夫祠堂建置<span class="s13">, </span>顧有财力何如耳<span class="s13">, </span>宗子不能建<span class="s13">, </span>諸子建之可也。諸子建祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>以宗子主祀事<span class="s13">, </span>或宗子有故<span class="s13">, </span>而以支諸子攝行祀事<span class="s13">,</span>揆諸禮<span class="s13">, </span>無不可者。</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">During the process of the construction of the Wu lineage ancestral hall, some people claimed that “sons of the collateral lines are not eli- gible to establish an ancestral hall” <span class="s12">支子不得立祠堂</span>, but Zhou Ying disagreed.

Each time they make offerings and announce prayers, this is under the supervision of the head of the lineage (<i>zuzhang</i>), and each of the descendants of each line (including the main descent line and the other minor descent lines) must follow his directions. Although this is not entirely in accordance with (classical) ritual, the important thing is that it places importance on the lineage, unites the kin and gathers people’s hearts. This comes close to achieving what the Book of Changes called the Way of “the gathering of the various streams”.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">莆人以族屬繁衍<span class="s13">, </span>不能遍立祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>故合族而為總祠<span class="s13">, </span>祀而群宗並舉。凡裸獻祝告<span class="s13">, </span>皆行於其族之長<span class="s13">, </span>各宗之子各以其屬從<span class="s13">.</span>雖於禮未盡合<span class="s13">, </span>要之重祖宗、合族屬、收人心<span class="s13">, </span>而《易》所謂聚渙之道<span class="s13">, </span>大概為得之矣<span class="s13">.</span><span class="s19">36</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This is to say that in the popular lineage halls of Putian, what was actu- ally going on was the gathering of the lineage to conduct the sacrifices together and that each first born descendant of a main line had to obey the commands of the lineage head. Moreover, even though this did not accord with classical ancestral regulation, it did indeed fit into the gathering together of the various streams (of the lineage), and thus was most reasonable.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In Ming Putian there were several rather conservative scholar gen- try who insisted that the construction of lineage halls and the sac- rifices to the ancestors must accord with classical ritual regulations, but they had no power to contain the reality of “overstepping of the regulations” that had become a common occurrence. All they could do was to try every which way to achieve a rational interpretation of these phenomenon. In Ming Zhengde 8 (1513), Lin Jun <span class="s12">林 俊 </span>, who had served as Minister of Punishments, wrote in his <i>Yishan Zengshi citang ji (Record of the Zeng ancestral hall of Yishan) </i><span class="s12">沂 山 曾 氏 祠 堂 記 </span>:<span class="s9">37</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">The (Family) Temples had their own Rules and Regulation, and yet later generations changed then into Ancestral Halls. And yet the sacrifices extended  (only)  to  the  great-great  grandfather,  and  so  the  Founding Ancestor and the early ancestors had no sacrifices.

Therefore the lineages through the ages have worshipped their Founding Ancestor, in order to tie the lineage together. This (new ritual order) was called a “Lineage Shrine”. Now if through the transmission of (responsibility for) the vari- ous rites the ritual regulations are transgressed, and if the main descent line is not established the ritual system becomes disordered. What I find problematic about the rites of most current lineage shrines (<i>shici</i>) is that their rites do not deserve close study and the meanings (of the ritual acts) cannot be fully expressed (within them), so I do find them worthy of recording. Now the shrine of the Zeng lineage of Yishan had ritu- als that were close to their meanings There is a single hall with three</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">niches. In the center (is worshipped) Zhonghu, the Founding Ancestor. On the left is Juzhai, the early ancestor. On the right is Taiyi, who is the ancestor of the main descent line. Now off in two other niches to the sides are the Tai Er generation to the left and the Taisan generation to the right. These are the minor descent lines. All five are exclusively managed by their respective main descent lines. People’s surnames and personal names are detailed on the tablets in the niches. If there is no major descent line (representative) there is no sacrifice offered, for fear of overstepping the ritual regulations. The other members of the lin-</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">eage sacrifice to their ancestors in their own homes. Thus the shrine has a set group of ancestors, and the lineage has fixed rituals, the kin of the lineage are united and filial reverence flourishes. The <i>Book of Rites </i>states, “How painful? Envy (over the overstepping of ritual roles).” Rit- ual change due to circumstances is also an aspect of the marvelousness of the (ritual) methods, through which human feelings are expressed, so that, with no obstruction, the meaning (of the ritual acts) becomes clear.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">廟有制<span class="s13">, </span>後世易以祠堂<span class="s13">, </span>然祭及高祖<span class="s13">, </span>則始祖、先祖皆無祭。子孫服盡<span class="s13">, </span>如同路人<span class="s13">, </span>故世姓有始祖之祀以聯族之合<span class="s13">, </span>謂之族祠。然傳敘俱祀而禮制踰<span class="s13">, </span>宗子不立而宗法亂。予於世祠禮不足稽而義不足以起<span class="s13">, </span>皆不記。沂山曾氏之祠<span class="s13">, </span>禮與義近焉。⋯⋯一堂三室<span class="s13">, </span>中锺壺<span class="s13">, </span>始祖也；右矩齋<span class="s13">, </span>先祖也；右太一<span class="s13">, </span>大宗祖也。别其旁二室<span class="s13">, </span>左太二<span class="s13">, </span>右太三<span class="s13">, </span>小宗祖也。五其主專之<span class="s13">, </span>子姓則名系於室之版<span class="s13">, </span>不主不祀<span class="s13">, </span>懼僭也。⋯⋯餘各祭於寢<span class="s13">, </span>則祠有定祖<span class="s13">, </span>祖有定祭<span class="s13">, </span>族屬合而孝敬興。《禮》曰<span class="s13">: “</span>傷哉<span class="s13">! </span>貪也<span class="s13">.” </span>禮之權<span class="s13">, </span>亦法之巧<span class="s13">, </span>以各伸其情<span class="s13">, </span>無嫌而義自見。</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Lin Jun expressed praise for the regulations of the Yishan Zeng lin- eage ancestral hall, primarily because they had made a clear distinction between the ancestors of the major and the minor lines, and had put the spirit tablets of these different ancestors into different niches in the lineage hall, enabling them to be used for distinct sacrificial purposes. He also argued that by writing the names of (descendants of) different descent lines on distinct spirit tablets, instead of all together on a single</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">316 zheng zhenman</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">spirit tablet, was another way of avoiding the overstepping of ritual rules. But in fact, the object of sacrifice and worship at the Zeng lineage ancestral hall was no different from that of the other “clan shrines”. Only at a formal, symbolic level did it appear to more closely abide with the demands of ritual regulations. Lin Jun also felt that it was necessary to worship and sacrifice to the (regional) founding ancestor, but that people should do so in accordance with “the Tang rule that those below the third rank should only offer up ritual prayers to the ancestors as a whole <span class="s12">唐制三品以下得舉禘祫之文</span>”, and that if so the ritual could be shown to have undergone some legitimate changes.<span class="s9">38 </span>During the Hongzhi period (1488–1505), the Lin lineage restored the tombs of their ancestors, and Lin Jun again remarked “The restoration of tombs and the sacrificing at the tombs is not an ancient custom, and if minor descent lines carry this out it is even more foundationless. But lifted up by ones emotions, meaningful (deeds) arise. Thus there is no harm in this becoming a ritual “<span class="s12">修墓、祭墓</span>, <span class="s12">非古也</span>, <span class="s12">小宗行之尤無據</span>.<span class="s12">然揆情起義</span>, <span class="s12">亦無害為禮</span>.”<span class="s9">39 </span>One can see that Lin Jun also advo- cated the idea that rituals arise from the meanings or intentions of the participants, and that it was thus permissible to create new rituals of ancestral worship in accordance with new social needs.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In popular activities of sacrifice to the ancestors in Putian, the ritual</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">regulations of antiquity and the sacrificial rites of the Confucians were constantly being overcome, with the result that Confucian scholar gen- try were forever trying to provide new interpretations of the principles of lineage law, and thus to establish new codes for ritual activity. These developments also reflect the continuing transformation of the lineage organization, as well as changes in regional culture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_175.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">38 </span>Lin Jun <span class="s16">林俊</span>, “Huangxiang Huangshi citangji <span class="s16">黃巷黃氏祠堂記</span>”, in Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995:No. 119, pp. 140–141.

In the pre-Qin period, the establishment of a <i>shê </i>altar and the carrying out of sacrifices to its god was the prerogative of the aristocratic nobility, closely linked to the feudal system of the division of land and the enfeoffment of feudal lords. <i>The Book of Rites: Methods of Sacrifice</i>, states “The King establishes the <i>Shê </i>altar on behalf of all the <i>xing </i>(surname groups), and this is called the Great <i>Shê </i>altar. The feudal lords establish a <i>shê </i>altar on behalf of the hundred surnames and this is called the <i>guoshê </i>(<i>shê </i>altar of the state), the nobleman takes those below him and gathers them into a group to establish a <i>shê </i>altar, and this is called “establish- ing a <i>shê </i>altar’”. From the Qin and Han onwards, when the imperial system of commanderies and districts overtook the feudal divisions, the <i>shê </i>gradually transformed into a symbol of different administrative regions. Thus one finds the provincial <i>shê</i>, or the district <i>shê</i>. Prior to the Ming, even though commoners often established their own <i>shê </i>altars and sacrificed to the gods, these actions do not seem to have given rise to any systematic rules or regulations, and they do not seem to have had any necessary relationship with administrative regions. In the early Ming, when the entire empire was establishing a unified system of <i>shê </i>altars within the sub-cantons of the empire, for the first time the popular sacrificial activities of the people’s <i>shê </i>altars were formally absorbed into the official administrative regulatory order. During the Ming and Qing, because the system of <i>shê </i>altars of the sub-cantons directly merged with the system of popular god temples, these developments had a profound influence on the transformation of regional social culture.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The earliest <i>lishê </i>(shê altars of the <i>li</i>) in Putian were in fact popular god temples, which differed from the official <i>shê </i>altars of the com- mandery or the administrative center.

What is the <i>shê </i>altar? It is not the <i>shê </i>altar of the commandery or the administrative city with its open-air altar, with only a (carved name tablet) but no icon. In any marketplace with three residences, or any settlement of a few households, there must be a shrine wherein people can pray for blessings and long life, with a god statue in it. I call these <i>lishê </i>(<i>shê </i>altars of the villages). Worshipping the village gentlemen in such a place shows that displaying reverence to the sagely is the same as serving the gods.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">古鄉先生歿<span class="s13">, </span>祭於社。社者何？非若郡邑之社不屋而壇也<span class="s13">, </span>有名號而無像設也。三家之市、數十戶之聚<span class="s13">, </span>必有求福祈年之祠<span class="s13">, </span>有像設焉<span class="s13">,</span>謂之 <span class="s13">‘</span>里社<span class="s13">’ </span>是也。祀鄉先生於是<span class="s13">, </span>敬賢之意與事神均也。</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">This means that the official <i>shê </i>altars had only an open-air altar and a carved name of the god. Thus they did not have temple structures and statues of the gods, both of which could be found in the <i>lishê </i>(village temples), in which one could also offer sacrifices to the village sages. The popular god temples of Putian were originally the site for the activities of the “shamanic invokers (of the gods)”, and were not under the purview of official ritual orders, thus they were often viewed as “excessive cults”. During the Song dynasty, because the scholar gentry class actively participated in the sacrificial rituals of the popular god temples, the ritual traditions and the symbolic meaning of the popular god temples underwent major changes, and some of the popular god temples were absorbed into the official register of imperial sacrifices. For example, the Shaoxing 8 (1138) <i>You Song Xinghuajun xiangying- miaoji </i><span class="s12">有宋興化軍祥應廟記 </span>states:<span class="s9">41</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Ten <i>li </i>to the north of Putian Commandery there is a god shrine, which is called the Temple of the Great Official. In 1107 Emperor Huizong had business in the southern suburbs (of Kaifeng), where he conducted sacrifices to the myriad deities. At this time, he called for reports from the local officials on the gods who were not included on the sacrificial register, be they the gods of famous mountains and great rivers or those gods that had performed meritorious service to the people. Thus the court first learned of the merits of this god from the people. The follow- ing year (1108) the shrine was granted the name “Shrine of Auspicious Response”. Nine years later (1116) the emperor conducted another sacri- ficial rite to the myriad deities at the Mingtang (Hall of Light: the Impe- rial Sacrificial Hall), and the people of our community again reported</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_177.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">41 </span>Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 14, pp. 11–14.

This was the fourth year of the Xuanhe reign period (1122). Note that as a Duke, the god already had his temple, where he received bloody sacrifice from the people on the occasion of the five seasonal rites As for the name, “Shrine of the</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Great Official”, it is said that there was a local man who rose to high rank. On retirement he returned to live out his old age in the village. Every year he led the most talented and virtuous youth and village elders on the day of the village festival (<i>shê</i>) in praying to the god for abundant harvests. They would carefully set out the plates and goblets, and spread the ritual vessels. Then they would bow humbly and ascend into the hall by order of age and with great humility. It was just like the ancient village wine drinking ceremony. The village people took great pleasure (in the ritual), and so they named the shrine The old temple had only</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">a few rooms, and had already lasted through many years of rain and wind above and all around, so that there was no longer anywhere to take shelter from (the elements). In 1083, Vice Minister of the Court of Impe- rial Sacrifices Lord Fang Qiao first expanded the grounds and enlarged the temple. In 1116, Supervisor of the Household Administration of the Heir Apparent Lord Fang Hui led the men of the village in raising funds and renewing the temple. Today (i.e., 1138) the god majestically faces the south, looking over his subordinates. The regalia and the rites of presenting offerings are all (performed) according to rank. One can see that this was quite different from the way (sacrifices) were done in the temple in the past. When the common people pray a Divination Mas- ter presents the text. They gaze upwards at the awesome visage (of the god), and are entirely sincere when approaching and moving back from the god. This we also see was very different from the way (the god was approached) in the past. At the time of spring and autumn sacrifices, the old and young proceed (before the god) in order, offering cool wine and fragrant victuals. “When the god is satiated (a quote from the <i>Book of Songs</i>)”—they withdraw to the position of guests, where they grasp their cups and hoist their goblets. As for admonishments and punishments, there are none who do not obey (the commandments of the god). Again, we cannot be certain that people in the past were like this. From near and far people come running to beg for spiritual power at the temple. Any new tidings are reported to the god, and movements away and back (to the village) are announced. If anyone is ill they must pray (to the god) and anyone who has upcoming affairs has to first prognosticate (by casting divination blocks) and only thereafter goes about their business. Again, who knows if people in the past were able to do things this way? (On major occasions, such as) when the Emperor performs the suburban sacrifices, and afterwards, whenever a new Prefect of (Xinghua) Com- mandery came to take up his post he would first come to worship and report to the god, in order to display his great sincerity—this also was something that did not occur in earlier times.

At the end of the Northern Song the temple received an official name and the god was enfeoffed, and the cult was absorbed into the offi- cial register of sacrifices. During this process, the scholar gentry elite continuously reformed the sacrificial rituals, in order to make them comply more closely with Confucian forms of sacrificial rites and the demands of the official register of sacrifices.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Many local gods from Putian received temple plaques and imperial enfeoffments over the Song dynasty. This caused local scholar gentry to play an even more active role in the god temple sacrificial rituals, leading to the reform of the <i>lishê </i>(village temple) sacrificial ritual order. In Xuanhe 5 (1133) the Shengdun ancestral temple which worshipped the Tongtian shennu (Goddess who communicates with heaven) of Meizhou received a temple plaque naming the temple Shunji <span class="s12">順濟 </span>(Temple of Harmonious Deliverance). The local powerful literati Li Fu <span class="s12">李富 </span>rebuilt the temple and reformed the sacrificial rituals. Some questions were raised, to the effect that:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 321</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Formerly the saint revered at Shengdun was placed on the central altar, while the white young god was on the right, and the divine goddess was off on the left. In the new temple, the goddess has been moved to the center of the main hall, and the god that was to her right has been moved the left, and the god on the left (has been moved to the altar) to her right. How could those who provide sacrifices and beseech spiritual powers before the temple not harbor some small doubts (about these changes).</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">舊尊聖墩者居中<span class="s13">, </span>皙而少者居左<span class="s13">, </span>神女則西偏也。新廟或遷於正殿中<span class="s13">,</span>右者左之<span class="s13">, </span>左者右之。牲醴乞靈於祠下者<span class="s13">, </span>寧不少疑<span class="s13">?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Li Fu’s dependant Liao Pengfei replied:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">The divine goddess was born on Meizhou, but her displaying of her spiritual powers actually began here at the (Sacred) Mound. Afterwards the temple was given an imperial plaque, and her cult was entered into the register of imperial sacrifices, and this too began here at this (Sacred) Mound (temple). Thus it is appropriate that the goddess should be placed in the main hall (of the temple).</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">神女生於湄州<span class="s13">, </span>至顯靈蹟<span class="s13">, </span>實自此墩始<span class="s13">;</span>其後賜額<span class="s13">, </span>载諸祀典<span class="s13">, </span>亦自此墩始<span class="s13">, </span>安於正殿宜矣<span class="s13">.</span><span class="s19">42</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This is to say, the rank and position of the god was not determined by the local tradition, but was determined by the imperial register of sacrifices. Liao Pengfei also argued that the symbolic meaning of a village temple cult arose from its connection to the register of impe- rial sacrifices, rather than from the “awesome spiritual powers” of the goddess herself. He stated:</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Li <span class="s13">have </span>shê <span class="s13">altars, and all under heaven sacrifice at them, but the people of Fujian are especially reverent. Vast and lofty temples, with solemn carved god statues, rise up imposingly facing south, showing the image of a kingly lord. How could this be a matter of overstepping the bounds of propriety in order to display beauty? Those gods who have benefited the people, and who have achieved merit in the eyes of the state, are honored with titles of enfeoffment. This is not a matter of merely show- ing off their awesome spiritual powers.</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">里有社<span class="s13">, </span>通天下祀之<span class="s13">, </span>閩人尤崇<span class="s13">.</span>恢閎祠宇<span class="s13">, </span>嚴飾像貌<span class="s13">, </span>巍然南面<span class="s13">, </span>取肖王侯<span class="s13">.</span>夫豈過為僭越以示美觀<span class="s13">? </span>蓋神有德於民<span class="s13">, </span>有功於國<span class="s13">, </span>蒙被爵號<span class="s13">,</span>非是列以彰其威靈也<span class="s13">.</span><span class="s19">43</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_178.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10">42 </span>(Song) Liao Pengfei (<span class="s16">宋</span>) <span class="s16">廖鵬飛</span>, <i>Shengdun zumiao chongjian shunjiimiaoji</i><span class="s16">聖 敦祖廟重建順濟廟記</span>” <span class="s16">南宋绍興二十年 </span>(1150), in Dean and Zheng, <i>Epigraphical Materials</i>, 1995: No. 16, pp. 15–17.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">43 <span class="s6">Ibid.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">322 zheng zhenman</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">This kind of <i>lishê </i>village temple which merged with the imperial reg- ister of sacrifices was in fact already a sign of identification with the imperial state.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The scholar gentry of Song Putian also used the system of enfeoff- ment to bring their own family gods into the imperial register of sac- rifices, in order to create a legal basis for their own forms of ancestral worship. For example, the god worshipped in the Xianjimiao (Temple of Manifest Salvation) of Shuinan (Huangshi) <span class="s12">水南顯濟廟 </span>was origi- nally a member of the Zhu lineage, who according to legend conducted many miracles during his life, and who was sacrificed to after his death in the Zhu lineage Chunxian shushê (Academy of the Gathered Gods)<span class="s12">群仙書社</span>. He was popularly known as Zhu Zongguan <span class="s12">朱總管 </span>(Gen- eral Zhu). In Jianyan 4 (1130) the temple received a plaque and an enfeoffment for the god, and in Baoyu 4 (1256) the god was promoted and given the title Fushun zhangliehou <span class="s12">福順彰烈侯 </span>(Duke of Brilliant Display of Blessings and Harmoniousness).<span class="s9">44</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">Thereupon, the members of the lineage felt that they had received (impe- rial) favor and praise and it was a grand affair at that time. They removed the name of the Gathering of the Gods Academy and put up the golden plaque which read “Imperially bequeathed Temple of Manifest Salva- tion”, and the founding temple was also renamed this way. Afterwards, descendants lived all around the temple in great profusion, and divided into the upper temple and lower temple (halls), and they continued to sacrifice to and worship the gods of the five grains, and used the temple for spring prayers and autumn rites of thanksgiving, while the lineage hall was maintained as before.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">於是<span class="s13">, </span>族人見恩寵褒光<span class="s13">, </span>一時盛事<span class="s13">, </span>乃去 <span class="s13">‘</span>群仙書社<span class="s13">’ </span>之號<span class="s13">, </span>匾金額曰 <span class="s13">‘</span>勅賜顯濟廟<span class="s13">’, </span>其祖廟亦如之。其後子孫環居眾多<span class="s13">, </span>分為上下廟<span class="s13">, </span>仍祀五穀之神<span class="s13">, </span>及為春祈秋報之所<span class="s13">, </span>祠堂則仍其舊。</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Zhu lineage of Shuiman were one of the prominent lineages of Putian, and in the Southern Song they produced an abundance of degree students “<span class="s12">衣冠蕃衍</span>”, totaling over forty-two officials.

At the same time, the emperor also commanded each sub-canton to establish a <i>litan </i><span class="s12">厲壇 </span>altar to the unrequited dead, to worship and sacrifice to the ghosts who receive no offerings, and to organize three sacrifices per year at these altars.

Each year [the representative of] one household will in rotation be group head. By a constant stream set up a pure altar. For the sacrifices in the spring and autumn one should in advance prepare the sacrificial objects. At the appointed day one must agree to gather for the sacrifice. The sacrifice requires one sheep and one pig; wine, fruit, incense, and candles may also be used as appropriate. When the sacrifices are finished, then carry out ritual wine drinking in the assembly. At the meeting first order one man to read the oath of restraining the strong and supporting the weak. When the oath has been read, the elderly and the young take their seats in order to extend their happiness to the utmost, and then retire. Their duty is to revere the spirits and bring harmony to the village All would</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">follow the Hongwu ritual regulations, in order to make local customs</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">profound.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">In every region each sub-canton of 100 families must set up one altar to sacrifice to the unworshipped spirits and ghosts. This is exclusively in order to pray for the peace and wellbeing of the people, and for the health and abundance of livestock. Each year there are to be three sacri- fices, in spring at <i>Qingming</i>, in autumn on 7/15, and in winter on 10/1. The ritual sacrificial animals and wine should be in accordance with local custom. The rotation of group heads and the wine drinking following the sacrifice, as well as other rites including the recitation of the oath are all the same as those for the <i>shê </i>altar of the <i>li </i>sub-canton.

On its surface, the Ming <i>lishê </i>sacrificial system aimed to establish a unified sacrificial ritual order that would absorb popular religious activity into an officially sanctioned ritual system, in order to prevent all kinds of heterodox teachings from taking the opportunity to foment chaos. However, because the <i>lishê </i>sacrificial ritual directly incorporated official classical models of sacrificial ritual, and did not build temples or set up god statues, it completely removed itself from the original popular traditions of the village <i>lishê </i>temples, and thus was unable to be successfully promulgated across the empire.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">So far we have not discovered any documentation on the concrete circumstances of the early Ming creation of the official <i>lishê </i>system in Putian. However, by following back the statements of later commenta- tors and by examining surviving cultural artifacts, it is clear that <i>shê </i>altars and <i>litan </i>altars were established in each sub-canton of Putian at that time. However, the sacrificial rituals commanded at the start of the Ming for the <i>lishê </i>and <i>litan </i>altars appear not to have been put into practice, and the traditional popular religious practices of the people do not appear to have been prohibited. The <i>Hongzhi Xinghuafuzhi </i>in its description of the <i>Lishê </i>system clearly stated “the rituals of the community <i>shê </i>altars have long since been abandoned, and those who seek to rule should seek to oversee the people and carry out these rites”<span class="s12">鄉社禮久廢</span>, <span class="s12">為政君子宜督民行之</span>.<span class="s9">48 </span>In its description of the annual <i>Yuanxiao </i>festival “community <i>shê </i>prayers for the coming year” we find the following description:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Each leader of the <i>shê </i>association gathers the masses at the middle of the month and carries out prayers for the coming year, with (Daoist) sacrifices. They carry the <i>shêzhu </i>(god of the community) on procession around the community boundaries. Drums and music lead the way, and lanterns light up the way. There is not a single family that is not visited (in these festivities). In Shuinan (Huangshi) of Putian, only the Fang, the Xu, and the Qiu lineages build open air <i>shê </i>altars and carry out sacrifices at them in spring and autumn. They do not follow in the roaming plea- sures of the <i>lishê. </i>Their rituals can be taken (as a model).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_182.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">48 </span>(<i>Hongzh</i>i) <i>Xinghua fuzhi </i>(<span class="s16">弘治</span>) <span class="s16">興化府志</span><i>, </i>j.21, p. 12, <i>Liyuezh</i>i <span class="s16">禮樂 志</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">326 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">各社會首於月半前後<span class="s13">, </span>集眾作祈年醮及舁社主繞境。鼓樂導前<span class="s13">, </span>張燈照路<span class="s13">, </span>無一家不到者。莆水南獨方氏、徐氏、丘氏<span class="s13">, </span>築壇為社<span class="s13">, </span>春秋致祭<span class="s13">, </span>不逐里社遨嬉<span class="s13">, </span>其禮可取<span class="s13">.</span><span class="s19">49</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">This illustrates that with the exception of a small number of great lineages the people of Putian no longer carried out sacrificial wor- ship at the <i>lishê </i>altars, but instead had broadly revived their traditions of inviting the gods and holding competitive festivals in their honor.

In the early Chenghua period (1465–1487), Peng Shao <span class="s12">彭韶 </span>stated in his <i>Yu Junshou Yue Gong shu </i>(Letter to Prefect, Lord Yue) <span class="s12">與郡守岳公書</span>:<span class="s9">53</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">Putian was originally a land of barbarians, and its excessive shrines are especially numerous. Even though powerful and outstanding leaders emerge regularly, even they are unable to reform (these cults). The gods that are worshipped are beyond categorization or comprehension. The leaders of the mean and humble, point out each month the birthdays of the gods, and collect money to sacrifice to them: at these times they transmit statements about disaster and good fortune in order to frighten the villagers, and many (political) rumors are spread in this way. At this moment the Confucian scholar Lin Bangjun who abhorred exces- sive cults requested to take control over them and went around to all regions and whenever he encountered the site of an excessive cult, he ordered that it be demolished. In standing temples, he established the two altars of the village <i>shê </i>and village <i>li</i>, in accordance with the Hon- gwu ritual regulations. He caused the village elders to lead their com- munity residents to conduct sacrifices at the appropriate seasons, and so there would be enough to sacrifice to the gods of the earth and grain, and the (unrequited dead of the <i>litan</i>) would not be hungry like ghosts with no descendants.<span class="s19">54</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">莆中故蠻地<span class="s13">, </span>淫祠特多<span class="s13">, </span>雖豪杰之士時出<span class="s13">, </span>未之能革。所祀神<span class="s13">, </span>類不可曉。奸黠之魁<span class="s13">, </span>每月指神生日<span class="s13">, </span>敛錢祭之<span class="s13">; </span>時出禍福語<span class="s13">, </span>以懼村氓<span class="s13">, </span>妖言之興<span class="s13">, </span>多由於此。此間有儒生林邦俊<span class="s13">, </span>酷怪淫祀<span class="s13">, </span>乞特委之<span class="s13">, </span>俾行四境<span class="s13">, </span>遇淫祀處<span class="s13">, </span>悉令除毁。就以所在廟宇<span class="s13">, </span>依洪武禮制<span class="s13">, </span>設立鄉社、鄉厲二壇<span class="s13">, </span>使鄉老率其居民<span class="s13">, </span>以時薦祭<span class="s13">, </span>庶足以祀土穀之神<span class="s13">, </span>而不餒若敖氏之鬼也。</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Peng Shao obtained his <i>jinshi </i>degree in 1457, and served as Minister of Punishments, and later retired to his home village.

Not long after this, another official forced out of court into retirement by the Great Rites Controversy, the Censor Zhu Zhe <span class="s12">監察御史朱浙</span>, also took part in the repair of the Yiqi dongshê <span class="s12">義齊東社</span>.

He kicked down temples, causing them to collapse and sink into an abyss. (At this time) Shadi alone lacked a grand temple. I made a plan with the Super- vising Secretary Zhang Bafeng, and we gathered together the collective efforts of the people, and repaired the temple . . . There was still the Shui- yungong Temple which had been left as a pile of tiles and bricks in a desolate heap for a long time. (This matter) had been delayed and the temple had not yet been restored. Important matters start with people. The reconstruction effort comes from the delight that people feel (for this project), and so it was accomplished with joking and laughter. The funds were contributed by the people, and there was labor to spare, and the work was done at once. We followed the original foundations, and then created new regulations. Construction began in the fourth lunar</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">month of 1547 and was completed by autumn.

From this we can see that after the destruction of illicit cults of the Zhengde period, the popular god temples of Putian had under- gone a very rapid recovery. Not only was this the case, after the mid- Ming the restoration of <i>lishê </i>was almost always linked to a popular god temple, and most of these <i>shê </i>altars had a god statue (representing the tutelary god). In Wanli 16 (1588), Fang Wanyou <span class="s12">方萬有</span>, a former<span class="s12">工科給事 </span>(Supervising Secretary in the Office for Scrutiny of Works), wrote in his <i>Xiaoyi lishê chongjian ji </i><span class="s12">孝義里社重建記 </span><i>(Record of the reconstruction of the Xiaoyi sub-canton shê altar)</i>:<span class="s9">63</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">The Xiaoyi <i>lishê </i>altar was formerly in Yujing street to the east of the Xiaoyi quarter. It was established at the beginning of the (Ming) by Adjutant LinYonghe and his followers in the sub-canton. Later it was destroyed by invading troops.

So until this day people refer to the Lin as the patrons (of the altar) The</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">altar was built in the <i>gui </i>position facing east. In the central hall were worshipped the (god of the) earth and the grains, along with vari- ous Saintly King gods, while the eastern chamber held the altar of the Immortal Maiden. In Jiajing <i>renxu </i>(1562) the temple was destroyed in the fires of battle. After the pirates had retreated, the son of Office Man- ager (Lin Youheng), Assistant Department Magistrate (Lin) Yangcheng encouraged people to repair the temple. The times were difficult and our strength was limited, so we temporarily lodged the gods. I regularly visited the temple to prostrate myself and pay respects to the gods, and my heart was never at ease, wishing as I did to argue for the reconstruc- tion of the temple, but never quite achieving this goal. In 1587 there was no rain, and the masses all prayed to the gods That autumn, in</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">the ninth lunar month, a child from a neighboring village was playing in the <i>shê </i>temple, when he saw three of the god statues suddenly rise up and stand before him. He told people about this but no one believed him. On the morning of the next day, suddenly there was a strange wind with a thundering sound, and the statue gradually emerged from its reliquary case and nearly lay down on the ground. Everyone found this extremely bizarre and ran to tell me about it. Thereupon we pre-</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">vailed on Instructor Zhuo Zhongli to be the main guarantor of the oath, with Gao Wen and Peng Sipeng as fund-raisers. Each gathered differ- ent amounts of money, and retired government officials especially were pleased to contribute and assist. We met in the early part of the second month. Taiyin Lord Gao-ren, Administration Vice Commissioner Lord Peng Wenzhi, Transport Assistant Lord Lin Yingsheng, and Officer of the Censorate(?) Lord Chen Zuyao, led the outstanding talented people in the sub-canton to carry out the ritual of praying for grain. Then we read out the oath and the prohibitions, and we were very numerous and talented and elegant.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">孝義里社故在玉井街孝義坊之東<span class="s13">, </span>國初參軍林公用和率里人創建者<span class="s13">,</span>後被武夫侵毁。正德庚戌<span class="s13">, </span>其六世孫都事公有恒<span class="s13">, </span>都憲公有守<span class="s13">, </span>購地於其東葵山巷中徙建焉<span class="s13">, </span>以是里人至今称林氏為檀越主云。 社位癸向東<span class="s13">, </span>中堂祀土估、聖王諸神<span class="s13">, </span>東偏一室為仙姑壇。 嘉靖壬戌<span class="s13">, </span>燬於兵燹。寇退<span class="s13">, </span>都事子别駕仰成倡眾修葺<span class="s13">, </span>時詘力乏<span class="s13">, </span>暫以棲神耳。余歲時伏謁<span class="s13">, </span>心竊不安<span class="s13">, </span>欲議改建<span class="s13">, </span>而未之逮也。歲丁亥春暮<span class="s13">, </span>不雨<span class="s13">, </span>眾盜於社。⋯⋯是秋九月<span class="s13">, </span>有鄰兒游社中<span class="s13">, </span>見聖王像恍然竦而立者三<span class="s13">,</span>告之人<span class="s13">, </span>弗之信。翼日巳候<span class="s13">, </span>怪風一陣聲轟轟<span class="s13">, </span>而像輒傾出龕外<span class="s13">, </span>幾卧地。眾咸鵬愕<span class="s13">, </span>奔告於予。⋯⋯迺介文學卓先生中立為主盟<span class="s13">, </span>高君文、彭君思鹏募眾<span class="s13">, </span>各捐金有差<span class="s13">, </span>而縉紳士多樂捐助。⋯⋯會兹仲月上戊<span class="s13">, </span>太尹高公□仞、參政彭公文質、運判林公應腾、憲□陳公祖堯<span class="s13">, </span>率諸里雋舉祈穀禮<span class="s13">, </span>讀誓誡<span class="s13">, </span>濟濟彬彬。</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The historical process of the repeated restorations of the Xiaoyi <i>lishê</i></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">all were led by local retired government officials, and all took place</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">332 zheng zhenman</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">inside of popular god temples.

It was dif- ficult to find any survival of the early Ming sub-canton <i>shê </i>altar sacri- ficial rites. But the system of <i>lishê </i>sacrifices had not disintegrated, but instead had transformed and expanded within the system of popular god temples. The Qianlong <i>Putian xianzhi </i>records:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">The <i>shê </i>altars of the sub-cantons were originally for the sacrifices to the god of the earth and the grain, but today they all build temples and mix in the sacrifices to other gods. Only Shangyu in Lianjiang, and Qian- huang in Daixianli sub-canton still preserve the open-air altar. As for the six <i>shê</i>-altars of Longpo, Xingtai, Yinghui, Tongying in Dongxiang, and Changshou in Zuoxiang, and Huangxiang Taiping in Yanshouli sub- canton, although they have built temples, they still have tablets dedicated to the god of the earth and the grain. Each spring and autumn, after they have gathered the community of the <i>shê</i>-altar and made their sacrifices, they read out the proclamation, and repeat the oaths and covenants. They then gather for the wine-drinking ceremony, and so they still pre- serve the ancient style (of the ritual).</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">里社壇<span class="s13">, </span>本以祀土穀之神<span class="s13">, </span>今皆建屋<span class="s13">, </span>雜祀他神。惟連江上余、待賢里前黃仍壇。 東厢龍坡<span class="s13">, </span>興泰、英惠、通應<span class="s13">, </span>左廂長壽<span class="s13">, </span>延壽里黃巷太平<span class="s13">, </span>六社雖建屋<span class="s13">, </span>尚立土穀神主<span class="s13">, </span>春秋集社眾祭畢<span class="s13">, </span>讀誥律、誓約<span class="s13">,</span>然後會飲<span class="s13">, </span>猶有古之遺風。</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The same source also states “As for the <i>litan </i>altars to the unrequited dead, each sub-canton followed the order to build them in the Hong- wu period to different degrees, and nowadays they are all gone <span class="s12">各里鄉厲壇</span>, <span class="s12">洪武間奉例建置不一</span>, <span class="s12">今俱廢</span>.<span class="s9">64 </span>This shows that by the Qing the early Ming system of independent <i>shê</i>-altars and <i>li-</i>altars had dis- appeared, and that only six or eight places maintained the sacrificial rituals of the <i>shê</i>-alter established in the Hongwu period.

In between the level of <i>li </i><span class="s12">里 </span>sub-canton, and the ten family <i>jia </i><span class="s12">甲 </span>units, there was another level in Ming Putian called the <i>tu </i><span class="s12">圖 </span>, which were made up of 100 families (like the <i>Li </i>elsewhere in China). According to the <i>Hongzhi Xinghua fuzhi</i>, there were over 100 <i>tu </i>units on the Putian plain, and so at most there should have been an equal number of <i>shê</i>-altars set up in that area in the early Ming.<span class="s9">66 </span>During the mid- Ming, when the <i>lijia </i>system was coming apart, the sacrificial rituals of the <i>lishê </i>altars also underwent a relatively independent development.

When I was a child, I heard the elders speak of its history in great detail. From them we know that the god had chased away adversity and driven off disaster showering kind- ness on the people of this land. This was not a matter of (miracles) of only a single generation. Thus it is reasonable to say that as for the mat- ter of requesting a title from the court and receiving an august title (for the god), all this began at that time with the efforts of the Vice Censor in Chief, the Honorable Shaoqi. The <i>shê </i>altar began when the Honorable Shaoqi retired and returned to his village, and chose, through divina- tion, lands to the left of his holdings. Thereupon, together with the Wu lineage of Xizhu, he led the residents of Xuqiao, Xishi, Gouxi and other <i>jing </i>(ritual territories) to donate land, gather funds, help with labor, and offer supplies. He united all their efforts to complete (the project). We can conclude that the hearts of people in those days were pure and true, (and that) the strong and the weak did not contrast themselves. They (developed the cooperative spirit of antiquity) in which “eight families collectively farmed their common plot”, and succeeded in generating a custom in which (all had good relations with one another such that) “all the neighboring households each deserved awards”. The Honorable (Shaoqi) compared things with this ideal state and desired to make his community just like that. So at once he united all the gentlemen of the <i>shê </i>who greatly delighted in following his (suggestions).</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -4pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">《禮》祭法<span class="s13">, </span>王為群姓立社<span class="s13">, </span>曰 <span class="s13">“</span>大社<span class="s13">”; </span>諸候為百姓立社<span class="s13">, </span>曰 <span class="s13">“</span>國社<span class="s13">”;</span>大夫以下成群立社<span class="s13">, </span>曰 <span class="s13">“</span>置社<span class="s13">” </span>。置社<span class="s13">, </span>今里社也。⋯⋯此我濠浦里社所由昉與<span class="s13">? </span>考社之建置<span class="s13">, </span>咸謂自明嘉靖始。賚為童子時<span class="s13">, </span>聞故老論其軼事甚詳<span class="s13">, </span>而知神之捍灾禦患<span class="s13">, </span>惠我鄉人者<span class="s13">, </span>非一世之積。 則謂當日之得請於朝而隆以徽號者<span class="s13">, </span>由中丞少淇公之力<span class="s13">, </span>理或然也。説者又謂社之興也<span class="s13">, </span>自少淇公歸田後<span class="s13">, </span>卜地於淇之西<span class="s13">, </span>爰與西洙ª氏率徐橋、西施、沟西等境<span class="s13">, </span>捐地鳩金<span class="s13">, </span>佽工庀材<span class="s13">, </span>合眾人之力以成。盖當時人心淳厚<span class="s13">, </span>强弱不形<span class="s13">, </span>以八家同井之風<span class="s13">, </span>成比戶可封之俗。公欲比而同之<span class="s13">, </span>而一時同社諸君子亦靡然樂從之。</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Because the Haopu lishê <span class="s12">濠浦里社 </span>sub-canton <i>shê </i>altar/temple was first built in the Ming Jiajing period, it lacked a legal foundation, and so Chen Bilai sought to provide a rational interpretation, moving from the sacrificial law set out in the <i>Book of Rites </i>to the actions of his ancestors who requested and were awarded an august enfeoffment. Actually, this kind of self-initiated construction of a <i>shê</i>-altar became a common phenomenon in the late Ming, and no longer required special explanations.

This had formerly been an old temple, which after being restored during</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lineage and religion on the putian plains 335</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">the Wanli period (1573–1620) was renamed as a <i>shê</i>.<span class="s9">69 </span>And this was not all, for inside Putian city there is also a Haopushê <span class="s12">濠浦社</span>, which claims to have been established by a Chen lineage member who moved into the city in the Qing.

For example, in the <i>Qiushi zupu </i>(<i>Qiu lineage genealogy</i>) of Jiangdong in Huangshi, we find:</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">It is said that there are prayers in the spring and thanksgiving sacrifices in the fall. From antiquity this has been the constant rule. Sacrificing to the (altar of the) harvest and (assuring) a smooth agricultural cycle, this has been a great rite passed down through the ages. The establish- ment of a <i>shê </i>altar is in order to respect this ancient regulation. From the founding of the Fude dongshê <i>shê-</i>altar (until now) has been many years Already at the 1839 autumn sacrifice it was clear that there were</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">“teaming insects rubbing against the beams” and “quickly arising argu- ments over insignificant matters” (i.e., small-minded, argumentative people). People’s hearts were no longer (kind and simple) like those of antiquity, and the affairs of the <i>shê </i>were sinking and lost. My lineage was offended by what they saw, and sad at heart. We were unwilling to simply let collapse all our earlier efforts. Thereupon in 1840, we gathered the men of our lineage and reconstructed the Fude dongshê. We did not forget the regulations of earlier generations, but developed newly estab- lished rules and regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_190.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">69 </span><i>Chongjian Xizhang haopushê beiji</i>, <span class="s16">重建西漳濠浦社碑記</span>, in Dean and Zheng,</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Epigraphical Materials<span class="s7">, 1995: No. 230, p. 265.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">70 </span>Putian Fushan dongyang Chenshi zupu, <span class="s16">莆田浮山東陽陳氏族譜</span><span class="s7">, j. 2, 63, </span>Jiagu<span class="s7">i</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">家規<span class="s7">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">336 zheng zhenman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: justify;">盖闻春祈秋報<span class="s13">, </span>古有常規<span class="s13">; </span>祀稷享農<span class="s13">, </span>久垂巨典<span class="s13">; </span>此立社所以遵古制也。福德東社自建社以來<span class="s13">, </span>蓋亦有年矣。⋯⋯逆料於道光十九年己亥秋祭<span class="s13">, </span>有蟻聚揉板之輩<span class="s13">, </span>頓生鼠牙雀角之争<span class="s13">, </span>人心不古<span class="s13">, </span>社事淪亡。我姓目擊心傷<span class="s13">, </span>未甘頓壞前功。 爰是道光二十年庚子歲<span class="s13">, </span>合族鳩丁<span class="s13">,</span>重興福德東社<span class="s13">, </span>不譜前人之矩矱<span class="s13">, </span>鼎興新立之規條。<span class="s13">71</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Fude dongshê <span class="s12">福德東社 </span>is in fact inside the Jiangdong Pukou Temple <span class="s12">江東浦口宫</span>, which is said to have been first founded in the Song, rebuilt in Ming Wanli 4 (1576) and repeatedly restored in Kangxi 28 (1689), Qianlong 21 (1756), and Jiaqing 16 (1811).<span class="s9">72 </span>Prior to Daoguang 19 (1839) the sacrificial system of Pukou Temple was made up of a common group of the major lineages, but after this date they divided into different <i>shê </i>(ritual associations).

In addition one finds the Xinan shoushê <span class="s12">新安壽社 </span>and the Dongchun shangshê<span class="s12">東春上社</span>, and other similar ritual organizations, made up of a com- bination of several local minor surname groups. These <i>lishê </i>sacrifi- cial organizations with lineages at their basis, clearly gradually formed after the Daoguang period (1821–1850), and so reflect the process of this region’s initial division and subsequent reorganization of the <i>lishê </i>system. However, currently these various <i>lishê </i>organizations, in addi- tion to separately carrying out their own <i>shê </i>sacrificial rites, also each year in rotation take on the organization of the birthday rites, celebra- tions, and processions around the collective boundaries for such local gods as Jianggong zhenren <span class="s12">江公真人 </span>and Zhanggong shengjun <span class="s12">張公聖君</span>, all of which results in a ritual organization with Pukou Temple at its center.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In some areas, the process of (division of <i>shê</i>) also took shape of a process of “division into temples”.

These later generation branch temples all used the name of their founding <i>shê</i>-altar when establishing their own <i>shê</i>-altar within their temples. For example, when the Fuhuitang temple of Xindun village<span class="s12">新墩村福惠堂 </span>divided off from the Xinxingshê of Houku village <span class="s12">後枯村新興社 </span>in Jiaqing 10 (1805), it also established a <i>shê</i>-altar called the Xinxingshê <span class="s12">新興社</span>.<span class="s9">73 </span>After this, one also finds a few temples that were built even more recently, and which have only a temple name and no <i>shê</i>-altar within the temple, such as the Longyoutang temple of Xindian village <span class="s12">新店村隆佑堂</span>, the Weixiantang temple of Zheche village <span class="s12">蔗車村威顯堂</span>, and the Jinshangong temple of Houchengpu village <span class="s12">後埕埔村金山宫</span>. In the Goushang seven village ritual alliance, all those villages with both <i>shê</i>-altars and temples generally carry out a procession each year during the <i>yuanxiao </i>festival around their village boundaries, indicating that they constitute a relatively independent <i>jing </i><span class="s12">境 </span>ritual territory. However, those villages without a <i>shê </i>but only a temple, do not have the full qualifications to constitute an independent ritual territory, and as a result they must take part in the processions of other outside villages.<span class="s9">74</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Most of the older <i>lishê </i>temples and god temples of the Putian plain have gone through the process of division of the <i>shê </i><span class="s12">分社 </span>or divi- sion of temples <span class="s12">分廟</span>, creating different kinds of ritual alliances and temple networks.

Generally speaking, the basic characteristic of these <i>qijing </i>ritual alliances is that through different levels of sacrificial ritual, they have united a number of lineages or villages, and thus constituted a relatively stable regional organization. Thus we can view these <i>qijing </i>as trans-lineage and trans- village social alliances.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">During the Ming and Qing, due to the fact that the <i>lishê </i>order and the system of god temples came together for various reasons, this led to the ritualization of the local administrative system. In the Putian irrigated plains, only by participating in the <i>lishê </i>sacrificial ritual organization could one obtain a legal social status. Only by directing the sacrificial rituals of the <i>lishê </i>could one control the system of local power. Because of these reasons, the development of the Ming and Qing <i>lishê </i>sacrificial ritual organization reflects in a concentrated form the process of growing local social autonomy and self management.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Conclusions</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Prior to the Sui and Tang, the Putian plain was the marshy rim of a deep bay. After the Tang, due to ceaseless reclaiming of land from the sea and the digging of ever more irrigation canals, an intricately irri- gated, densely settled coastal plain was formed. In this kind of a local society access to water via irrigation was the most important of envi- ronmental resources. In order to control water resources and maintain the irrigation infrastructure, there developed over time many different kinds of irrigation collectives.<span class="s9">75 </span>The historical organization of the lin- eages and religious institutions of Putian in fact have many character- istics that are a direct result of these irrigation collectives.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The traditional popular social organizations of Putian were primar- ily the lineages and the religious organizations.

In the Yuan and Ming, the lineages gradually began to detach themselves from the monastic system, and developed into the fundamental form of the popular social organization. In the Ming and Qing period, because of the continual expansion of the self-governing powers of the lower levels of society, there developed all kinds of trans-lineage and trans-village alliances, which find their most important expression in the system of local god temples and its ritual organizations.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The development of the Putian lineages and religious organizations after the Tang was restricted and constrained, in the early period by Buddhism, and then by Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism and by the Ming <i>lishê </i>regulations. This shows that the Chinese historical ide- ology of total unity and its political system had a profound impact on regional socio-cultural development. However, local socio-cultural traditions did not on this account break off, rather they continued to absorb outside resources in order to obtain new developmental forces. The historical Putian scholar gentry elite played a major role in the pro- cess of regional socio-cultural development. They were always actively responding to changing conditions and historical trends, and attempt- ing to put forward rational appropriations and reforms of orthodox ideology and governmental regulations, in order to forge out of them legal bases for their continual re-construction of regional culture and continual re-invention of traditions. In these ways they pushed for- ward the development and transformation of forms of regional society and culture. In the study of Putian socio-cultural history, one must pay close attention to the scholarly transmission and social practices of the scholar gentry elite.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">[This essay was first published in <i>Lishi yu renleixue xuekan </i><span class="s12">歷史與人類學學刊 </span>(<i>History and Anthropology</i>) 4.1 (2006): 1–28.]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">APPENDIX ONE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: center;">LEGENDS OF THE MAIN SURNAMES OF THE PUTIAN PLAIN (BASED ON THE ACCOUNT IN ZHANG QIN’S <i>PUTIAN XIANZHI</i>)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Chen <span class="s12">陳 </span>were one of the “eight great surnames” who moved to Fujian during the Eastern Jin.

Others spread to Baitang Qiangou <span class="s12">白塘前沟 </span>and Gongxi <span class="s12">鞏溪</span>. The Huang of Weizhuang <span class="s12">渭莊 </span>moved to Putian from Quanzhou, but they also trace their ancestry back to Huang An <span class="s12">黃岸</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The Zheng had moved to Fujian by the Eastern Jin, when Zheng Zhao <span class="s12">昭 </span>served as Prefect of Quanzhou <span class="s12">泉州太守</span>.

His grandson Zhang Bao <span class="s12">寶 </span>moved from Yongfu Yuezhou <span class="s12">永福月洲 </span>to Heng- tang <span class="s12">横塘 </span>in Putian. In the Ming, a descendant named Zhang Jing<span class="s12">經 </span>served as Jiaoshulang <span class="s12">校書郎</span>, and his descendants lived in Shadi<span class="s12">沙堤</span>, Chiqi <span class="s12">赤歧</span>, Yangdai <span class="s12">洋埭</span>, Qiwei <span class="s12">岐尾</span>, Changji <span class="s12">長基</span>, Mayang<span class="s12">馬洋 </span>and Nanri Island <span class="s12">南日</span>, while the others dispersed into many locations. This is the Qujiang line <span class="s12">曲江派</span>. In the Song, the descen- dants of Zhang Shijie <span class="s12">張世杰 </span>moved from Zhanghou <span class="s12">漳州 </span>into Putian and settled in Shali Xiapu <span class="s12">沙里下鋪</span>, Yanshou <span class="s12">延壽 </span>and Yuhu <span class="s12">玉湖 </span>villages.

The temple is like a boat on the sea, which sometimes rises and sometimes falls in accordance with the prevailing winds of the times, flourishing and diminishing in turn. Yet the pow- ers of the gods are limitless and they always find ways to enpower so many good men and trustworthy women, both within the land and overseas, to show their concern and love and protect them. (These people) performed such heart warming acts, exhausting their hearts and energies both before the cart and after the horse, selflessly offering their efforts. Their deeds will not be itemized one by one below, but the gods keep a close account of these deeds as closely as they observe the autumn hairs, and each and every one is recorded in the registers of merit. Their acts, which could be put into song or verse, will last throughout the ages.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Fu(qing), Pu(tian) and Xian(you) Zhiyuantang (Hall of Willing</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the Primordial) is a combinatory style temple with the worship of the Lord of the Three in One at its center. The Lord of the Teachings is the Ming philosopher from Putian Lin Zhao’en (1519–1597) who pro- pounded his teachings during the 30th year of the Jiajing reign period of Ming Shizong (1551), over 400 years ago.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">During the Wanli reign period of the Ming (1573–1620), the Three in One adherents Huang Zonglu, Shi Xia, Huang Boqi and others built the Zhiyuantang in Shiting, behind Huangcuo. The Qing pol- icy of coastal evacuations led to an unprecedented economic disaster for the common people. Nine homes out of ten were abandoned (in this area). After undergoing over one hundred years of unbelievable transformations, the ravages of wind and rain, and long periods of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">356 appendix two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">disrepair, brought the temple to the brink of collapse. Then the temple underwent several cycles of restoration and decline, until in Guangxu 8 (1882) the Three in One adherent Xu Junfu, Huang Junjie and oth- ers divined a new location, and moved and rebuilt the temple on the north side of the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway in Shiting. This place is locally known as Dingdian. The carved pillars and painted beams and the golden icons were magnificent and without comparison. Corri- dors linked to side chambers, which surrounded the main hall of the temple. The “tails” of the raised corners and the rising eaves of the buildings matched one another. The bluegreen willows competed with the leaves of the banana plants in showing off the beauty of their danc- ing. The wind chimes hanging from the eaves competed in singing with the sounding lions on the walls of the compound. Within the precious hall colorful flowers were arrayed and sandalwood incense in the bronze incense burners filled the air. An endless stream of wor- shippers sincerely bowed before the altar. This was a fine sacred site of the followers of the Dao, whose scenery would rival those in the <i>Book of Songs </i>and the <i>Book of Documents</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The sun rose and the moon waned, the Big Dipper traversed the sky</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">and the stars circled year after year until the 30th year of the Repub- lican period, 1941, which was the difficult period of the Anti-Japanese war. That year there was also a rare spring drought and the riverbeds of the great river all split open like cracked lips, bringing hardship and suffering. The common people had little clothing and less grain, “piling frost on top of snow”. They stared longingly at the rice seed- lings that could not be transplanted. The hot poisonous sun shone unfeelingly on their bitter faces, all covered with wrinkles. The Initi- ates (of the Three in One) with burning hearts all day prayed before the thrones of the gods. The pitiful cries of “please save the common people and sprinkle a rain” filled the temple courtyard. Finally there was a response. On morning in the second half of the third month an Initiate discovered that the golden sedan chair of the Jindougong god had moved forward by over a foot (on its own). Everyone found this exceptionally strange, so they burned incense and requested commu- nication via spirit writing. The god replied that he wished to be taken out to pray for rain. People just did not understand. There were no clouds at all in the heavens, and in the past several days many brother temples had taken their gods out to pray for rain without getting a drop of rain in response. If we too took our god out without getting any rain this would be a great loss of face. Nonetheless, the god’s medium</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a recently carved stone inscription from shiting, putian 357</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">again indicated that if there were was a crow that cawed three times to the east at the <i>mao </i>hour (5–7 AM) the next day, then they should immediately carry the god out of the temple. The next day all these signs took place. Thereupon they invited the Military Official Huang Tianyou to wear sackcloth and dress himself as a filial sons in mourn- ing. The initates all wore white clothes and trousers. They invited (the gods) Lord Xu and the Lord Jindou and the other revered god statues to leave the temple. At around 8 in the morning, the praying for rain procession set out in an orderly and solemn fashion. All along the route one heard the sound of bells and drums and the shouts of those begging for rain, which went on and on without end. The procession passed the Mingde Hall (of Bright Virtue), commonly known as the Caiwu Buddhist Monastery. They stopped at the Lord Zhang Cavern in the Zhongjing streambed. At the gods instruction they entered the cavern to collect water. (The god indicated that) if there were three small fish found in the water, then rain would come. The Initiates went into the cave for about forty or fifty lengths, and finally came upon a small pool of water. Using a basin in the complete darkness they simply filled it up with water. When they emerged the first thing they saw were three small fish swimming (in the basin). It is said that a deaf dragon sleeps in the cave. Only if you wake it up will it rise up to heaven and distribute the rain with the clouds. So the young people climbed to the highest point (on the mountainside above the cave) and pushed loose a great boulder which rolled down the hill. The elders struck gongs and drums in front of the cave. The sound of the rolling boulder as it crashed down the hill, the sound of the gongs and the drums, and the echoes of the mountains startled the heavens and moving the earth. Finally they aroused the deaf dragon. At around ten in the morning the skies were empty and clear for a myriad miles. Suddenly, from behind the mountain, a black cloud rose into the sky. Gradually it grew larger and expanded in every direction. A gust of cold air blew from the mountain side, closely followed by peals of thunder and bolts of lightning, Raindrops the size of soybeans were scattered by the wind. The praying for rain procession circled around from east to west through the downpour, moving slowly as they went. As they processed, they used sprigs of pine to sprinkle water from the mountain cave on the ground. The multitudes along their path were soaked in rain as they took off their red clothes and removed their bamboo hats to kneel and worship without end. Wherever the procession went the sweet rain followed. At that time their only worry</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">358 appendix two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">was that the clay icons would be soaked and damaged by the rain, so at around 6 in the afternoon they returned to the temple. Not long after the great downpour stopped. The rain had already filled up the irriga- tion canals and soaked the paddy fields. The miraculous powers of the god were set into stone through many people’s accounts. To this day in the hearts of old people this memory is still fresh in their minds.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">In a flash, two years quickly passed by. At mid-autumn, continuous downpours caused the dikes of Houcuo in Jiangkou to burst. The vast floodwaters swamped all the cultivable lands of the Jiuliyang irrigated plain, forcing the chickens and ducks onto the rooftops, and causing coffins to crash into the doorways of homes. After the floodwaters receded, there was a terrible outbreak of bubonic plague, which swiftly afflicted the poor people who lived in a land of deep waters and hot weather. The Initiates took the relieving of suffering and adversity as their own vocation. Following the indication of the gods, they gath- ered wild herbs and medicinal plants and used these to heal many sick people. At the time, crowds of people came and went, seeking bless- ings or escape from plague and illness or repaying vows and thanking the gods. Truly this was a matter of spiraling clouds of incense and endless explosions of firecrackers.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1947 the Initiate Huang Yaxin and others, who were sojourning</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">in Malaysia, wished to worship the Lord of the Teachings day and night, and to continue the propagation of the combining into one of the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. They respectfully followed the clear maxims, and took the three bounds and the five constants as their daily practice. On entering (their homes) they were filial, and when exiting they displayed respect (for their elders). They treated the pathways of scholar, farmer, worker, and merchant as their standard occupations. They pursued these teachings in their homes and carried them out throughout the world. They promoted the beautiful Chinese virtues of delighting in good works and continuous chariity. They thereupon took the incense of the ancestral Zhiyuantang Temple and (used it as the basis for) building a Three Teachings Hall Zhiyuantang Temple in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Later, as passenger ships shuttled back and forth like shuttles on a loom, the incense fire of the Zhiyuantang became more and more expansive.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Light and dark fly like an arrow, and the sun and moon are like</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">shuttles on a loom. After Liberation, the great tide of destruction of superstition gathered speed and circled about. All the sincere (reli- gious) affairs of the entire country immediately came to a stop. Even</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a recently carved stone inscription from shiting, putian 359</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">the Zhiyuantang could not avoid this fate. In 1964 the Socialist Educa- tion Campaign rolled over the entire country. In the wake of the expel- ling of the Buddhist monks and the burning of their scriptures, the shattering of god statues, and the campaign to annihilate superstitious (beliefs), all the movable and even the immovable property inside the Hall was crushed into sweet potato powder, and the temple gradually was reduced into a wasteland, providing the eye with a vision of sor- row and desolation. Then things got even worse during the ten year apocalypse (kalpa, i.e. the Cultural Revolution). During the campaigns to “Destroy the Four Olds and Build up the Four New”, the Zhiyu- antang Temple went from being real (temple) to a site that had lost all trace of having once been a temple. But the radiant supernatural gods had already left a glowing trace within the hearts of the faithful multitudes.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In 1979 after the dispelling of the chaos and the return to the ortho-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">dox, there was a restoration of the policy of complete religious freedom. The many Initiates recommended continuing the incense fire (of the temple). In 1980 the Singapore sojourners, including believers Huang Qiugui and Huang Wenli, and the Malaysian Initiate Huang Yaxin, etc., returned frequently to their homeland. They recommended the rebuilding of the temple. After extensive investigations, it was finally decided to select a site in the Xiadu section of the Shidong village of Shiting. The temple committee, with Altar Master Huang Huarong of Xinxing at the lead, was elected to take charge of the reconstruction. On the 4th day of the 3rd [lunar] month of 1983,<span class="s9">1 </span>they began the full scale construction project. The masses pressed forward, sincerely offering contributions of cash or labor. Their hearts were sincere. But in the course of the construction the economics of the project hit a snag. Even after extensive debates the intense worries could not be resolved. Then the believer Huang Qiugui heard about this, and gener- ously opened up his savings and donated 13,000 RMB to the Zhiyuan- tang Temple, thereby assuaging the burning worries over the project by his standing firm like a rock in midstream. This ensured the smooth construction of the main hall, which reached its initial completion. On the 13th day of the 11th lunar month of 1986 the consecration rites were held. And on the 15th day the first <i>chijie </i>(closing of the temple doors to receive the prohibitions—a spirit medium training</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="63" height="0" alt="image" src="vol1/Image_201.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 <span class="s7">Note that dates are given according to the lunar calendar.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">360 appendix two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">session) was held with the (mediums) entering the inner altar. Sub- sequently, on 26th day of the 11th lunar month of 1987 the second <i>chijie </i>(training session) was held, and on the fourth day of the elev- enth lunar month of 1988 the third <i>chijie </i>(training session) was held, and the Daoist rites of <i>yuxiu </i>(preparation for immortality) were also conducted at that time. Then right away, with the speed of sounding gongs and beating drums, they began planning the construction of the front hall of the temple. The groundbreaking rite was held in 1991. After much hard work they obtained the support and help of good men and trustworthy women from Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as local people. The building of the front hall of the temple went as smoothly as flowing water. In the 4th lunar month of 1993, the Indonesian adherent, Madame Chen Guan Meiying, together with her entire family, contributed a pair of cloud piercing wooden flag posts, which were erected in front of the temple, displaying four colored embroidered banners which fluttered in the colored smoke of auspicious incense. A believer from Dong’ao in Fuqing, Chen Guocheng, reverently offered a hundred meter long marble slab for the Zhiyuantang temple road. The Indonesian Huang Meiying and her family reverently contributed an open air opera stage. Another foreign compatriot donated a “Xiadu” Bridge (over the Auro- ral Mist) and a second open air stage. These projects were completed one after another. On the eighth day of the eighth lunar month of 1993 the consecration rites were held for the front hall. On the 14th day of the month, another <i>Chijie </i>(spirit medium training) was held and the altar was closed off (for the trainings). With the support and personal attendance of the leaders of the Provincial Bureau of Religious Affairs, on 10th day of the nineth lunar month of 1994, the first Putian City- wide Daoist [Association] Committee was set up, together with an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">In order to commemorate the memory of those who had gloriously</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">sacrificed themselves during the War of Liberation, and to deliver a number of men and women who had died unnatural deaths, in accor- dance with the intense demand of the great mass of believers, on the 24th day of the eleventh lunar month of 1994, with the financial sup- port of overseas and local believers and with the heartfelt assistance of [Three in One] Initiates from brother temples, a three day long, large- scale Mulian Requiem ritual was held. With the sounding of cymbals by the Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, the rites were conducted. Couplets reading “Seek not pardon if you are poor, nor feel pride if</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a recently carved stone inscription from shiting, putian 361</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">you are wealthy: if each in accordance with his lot acts faithfully, all shall complete the Way of the Buddha”; or “Fathers spoke of tender- ness and children spoke of filiality, producing a heavenly harmonious- ness in their homes”, were pasted upon the Mulian stage. The Great God who Fixes the Stage (Tiangong yuanshuai?) waved his hands and nodded his head, as though he was repeatedly admonishing the people of the world to perform more good deeds and do less evil acts. The candles within the House of Ghosts flickered as though whispering to people about their inner resentments and unhappiness. Wave after wave of clashing cymbals accompanied the sound of Sanskrit chant- ing as prayers were made for the prosperity of the nation and the health of the people and for eternal peace. Finally, with the sounding of the immortal’s songs of the requiem service and the explosions of fireworks, the Mulian ritual sacrements were completed. This realized the dreams of many people over many years for the repayment of their vows.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Spring passed and autumn came, and in 1997 after receiving indica-</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">tions (from the gods) on the 4th day of the 8th lunar month, the fifth <i>chijie </i>ritual of upholding the prohibitions (spirit medium training ses- sion) began in a tumultuous chorus of sounds. Those who participated in the <i>chijie </i>rite included people who reside overseas as well as hon- ored guests and friends of the Dao from other regions. They all harbor a burning hot patriotic love for their country and a sincere heart. They took precious time away to return to their homeland to complete a pilgrimage and to witness the proceedings. The “moving palace” on the eastern stage, carefully designed and exquisitely decorated by the temple managers of brother temples, was as resplendent and awesome as a palace-temple. Its grandeur inspired respect, which arose from peoples’ deepest feelings. On the 6th day of the month, in the “mov- ing palace”, the ritual of opening up the Yamen Headquarters of the gods, prior to the Tour of Inspection, was carried out. In the morning and the evening, the Official of the Banquet (equivalent to a Lisheng, Confucian Master of Rites) called the hall to order and later dismissed the assembly, surrounded by the shouts and songs of the <i>Baban </i>(Eight Guards). The <i>Chijie </i>(spirit medium training) rites lasted for nine days, and concluded at the <i>mao </i>hour (5–7 AM) on the 13th, to the con- testing sounds of booming ritual firework-guns and the clashing of drums and gongs, along with the simultaneous playing of songs and music and the sounding of immortal tunes, and the flashing colors of exploding of bamboo tubes and colorful fireworks. The gates of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">362 appendix two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Inner Altar were opened and the mass of Initiates, led by the spirit medium lads, in an orderly fashion, each in their place, holding flags in their hands, strode out of the Altar gates, and worshipped at the entranceway to the temple. At 8 AM, the procession advanced, led by a motorcycle troupe. The (all-female) drum-cart cymbal troupes of each village, eight-instrument troupes, palace-music bands, the ten-sounds musical troupes, and decorated floats enacting stories from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties opened the way. The General’s Cannon, the Messengers who race the Documents, the Officials who carry the Banners, those who sweep the streets as they go, and those who follow carrying incense, those who rode on horseback, and those who walked along, each carried out and completed their assigned task. The Great Banner, the Wenchang Banner, the Dragon and Tiger Ban- ners, the Ten Dipper Stars of the Five Directions banners, the Col- ored Banners, the Incense tower, the Twelve Taibao, the spirit-ponies and their horse-keepers, the “Ten Punishments for Ten Evil Deeds” troupes who urge the people to do more good deeds and less evil acts, the Baban (Eight Temple Guards), the Incense Lads dressed in black and yellow, the Eight Arhat Palanquin, and the Carved Palanquin passed by with powerful, swaying steps, in an endless and magnificent procession stretching out over four <i>li </i>long. Drums and gongs shook the heavens, Immortal tunes were resonant. The places they passed surrounded them in clouds of incense and the explosions of Ritual firework-guns—(creating) an entire landscape of Ascendant Peace. At around 6 in the afternoon, the palanquin bearer youths came rush- ing up and ran back into the temple. The great procession, which the masses had been waiting for in their hearts for many decades, had finally been accomplished.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In the early 4th intercalary lunar month of 2001, the first Altar Mas-</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">ter Huang Huarong passed away. With the agreement of the entire group of the followers of the teachings and the approval of the gods, an elder of the Altar, Huang Yulin, a man of great virtue and vision, was unanimously selected to be the Second Altar Master. He also man- aged the reconstruction of the back hall where the altar beneath the statues was too low. The gods revealed through divination that on the 20th day of the 8th lunar month the groundbreaking rites should be held. Carefully selected timbers replaced the concrete beams, and new pillars were set up. Carved dragons and phoenixes were placed on top of the beams, and were painted with gold leaf and red paint. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a recently carved stone inscription from shiting, putian 363</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">interior of the hall was completely transformed and made new. On the 15th day of the 7th lunar month of 2002, a ritual of consecration and “entering the hall” was held to commemorate the completion of the work. Before the smoke of the donated ritual firework-guns had cleared away, the gods revealed that they had divined the auspicious date for the sixth <i>chijie </i>rite (of spirit-medium training). Preparations began, and with the desire of good men and faithful women overseas and locally to do good deeds and to broadly plant merit in the land of blessing, on the 13th day of the 11th lunar month of 2002, at the <i>shen </i>hour (3–5 PM), accompanied by a string of elegant songs of the immortals, cloud–sending sounding drums and gongs, and the thun- der of exploding ritual fireworks, the Gates of the Altar were closed. Multi-colored banners and red lanterns were lined up to greet the guests to the ritual. Colored lanterns and neon lights flickered their beautiful good wishes and profound blessings to the faithful masses. After the conclusion of the <i>Jiao </i>ritual, as fast as rapidly beating gongs and drums, plans were laid for the (construction of the) Hall of the Limitless. In the beginning of the 2nd lunar month of 2003, the groundbreaking was done for the Hall of the Limitless. Goodhearted and trustworthy believers, who sincerely sought to generate good for- tune, gathered together many small contributions (into an adequate sum), and put their minds together to great purpose, (and thus) finally a temple hall brilliant without compare was completed. (It had) golden shining gods, murals that seemed about to come to life, delicate and multivarious carvings, and marvelous, heavenly paintwork. The hall and its corridors adjoined one another, and the corridors connected to the bell tower. Green dragons dive across from each other, and facing pairs of colored phoenixes dance in unison. The beauty of the temple is resplendent and the ornamentation is balanced and orderly, the stones are set like a chessboard and the exotic flowers and rare plants are lovely. How beautiful, how striking! The incense smoke con- stantly swirls, it seems that people walk into a land of the immortals. On the 8th day of the 11th lunar month of 2004 the consecration of the temple was held. At the <i>mao </i>hour (5–7 AM) the heavens were clear and a gentle breeze blew. The auspicious incense smoke of two mas- sive bonfires reaching to the sky, and billowed into clouds around the statues of the gods. To the sound of gongs, drums, and fireworks, and the chanting of the Daoist ritual masters, solemnly and in an orderly fashion, the wisdom eyes of the god statues were opened (by dotting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">364 appendix two</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">their pupils). On the 19th, with the sending off of honored guests, the great task (of the construction) of the Hall of the Limitless was suc- cessfully completed.</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">After the initial sounding of the bells of 2005, the Altar Master Huang Yulin again set in motion plans (for expansion of the temple). In the 1st month groundbreaking began at the site of the western Drum Tower. A battering of wind and rain had already soaked the pair of wooden flagpoles, and they were tottering and threatening to collapse. The gods revealed that on the 8th day of the 5th lunar month, in accordance with their earlier indicated time, on the site of a small irrigation canal outside the walls of the temple compound, ground- breaking should commence. On an auspicious hour on the 2nd day of the 10th lunar month, a set of Tianshan red stone slabs, in three sections each, standing 16 meters high, were erected into a pair of tow- ering, awesome flagpoles in front of the temple compound. The Duke of the Wind retracted his great fans, and the Goddess of the Clouds let down her vast sleeves. One saw only an auspicious cloud rising alongside the flagpoles. The colored cloud floated lightly between the pillars and then passed by, providing a highly auspicious image. (Con- struction work on) the Western Drum tower and the old alter hall went on busily, but in an orderly fashion. With the fervent help of overseas and local good-hearted and trusting supporters, under the careful direction of skilled stonemasons, carpenters, carvers, painters and builders, in the 6th lunar month of 2006 the entire building clus- ter was completed. Shining back and forth and reflecting the beauty of the temple compound on the east side, this cluster of ancient style buildings completed the pair of Bell and Drum Towers, which then became a pair of loyal guardians protecting the two sides of the temple complex. These winged corners are like hands raised in sincere and respectful greeting to visiting incense worshippers. At any time one’s ears can be delighted by the auspicious news carried by the happy swallows (in these towers).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12"
