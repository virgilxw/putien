Xiadun 下墩 1. Village settlement The village of Xiadun has a population of over 800 people living in over 150 households. The main livelihood is farming, supplemented by lychee trees and fishing. According to local legend, the deep channel behind the village was known as the Turtle Channel, and was the lair of a turtle demon. Every time the weather changed, he would rise up out of his hole and float on the surface of the water. Then he would gobble up the spirits of the men of the neighboring village of Loutou 漏头, causing them to wither and decline. Later a geomancer destroyed the turtle, and its corpse floated to the surface. Thus in the channel there formed a small islet surrounded by water, where the village of Xiadun 下墩 formed. Currently the village sets up a red banner when they race their dragon boats. 2. Surname groups The village is made up of only the Lin 林 and the Chen 陈. The Xiadun Lin came from Shanglin village, while the Chen came from Kuokou 阔口 outside Putian city. 3. Village temples 1) Xiadunjing Longboshê 下墩境龙波社 branched off from the Shanglin Longboshê 上林龙波社. In 1982, the Singapore Overseas Chinese Lin Wenqi 林文棋 and Lin Jinsuo 林金锁 repaired the temple. On the main altar is Zunzhu mingwang 尊主明王 and Houtu furen 后土人人, to the left are Wencao 文曹 (civil ministers) and to the right Wupan 武判 (military officers). 2) Anhuaigong 安怀宫 was built in the Qing Qianlong period (1736– 1795) and restored in 1985. Inscriptions on the temple commemorate the contributions of Overseas Chinese from Singapore. The main gods are Tiangong yuanshuai 田公元帅, Qitian dasheng 齐天大圣, and Xuantan yuanshuai 玄坛元帅. Left altar: Zhanggong shengjun 张公圣君, Wenwu zhushen 文武诸神. Right altar: Wusheng tianfei 吴圣天妃. 4. Rituals: Yuanxiao processions On 1/12 the Lin 林 pray for good fortune上元祈福.

Each year eight Fushou 福首 rotate into positions of responsibility for the management of the rituals. Daoist ritual masters are invited to recite scriptures and conduct a jiao 念经做醮. As an old saying goes, “Gong 公, Ma 妈 and Hou 侯 got under way together.” Eight ritual managers are selected in rotation according to age. Daoist ritual masters are invited to conduct the rites. Birthday celebrations of the gods 1/25–26: The first opera of the year 头条戏 is performed. 2/1: The celebration of Zunzhu mingwang 尊主明王 and Houtu furen 后土夫人. Opera is performed for one day. In the fourth lunar month the celebration of Heaven and Earth is held and there is opera for two days. 8/8: The celebration of Wusheng tianfei 吴圣天妃 is held, with opera for five to six days. 5. Ritual Groups There are no Daoists, Tanban altar association, spirit mediums, or opera or marionette troupes in the village. At Yuanxiao, Daoist masters are invited in from outside villages, and Buddhist monks are invited in to perform the xiayuan pudu rites of Universal Deliverance (in the 10th lunar month). On the birthdays of the gods, opera troupes or marionette troupes are invited in to perform. Originally, the goddess Wusheng tianfei 吴圣天妃 would possess a spirit medium and transmit messages via planchette but this tradition has diminished in recent years. In 1960 the spirit medium went to Singapore to the Anhuaigong 安怀宫 there at the invitation of Lin Wenqi 林文棋, a Singapore Overseas Chinese. There he continues to transmit the messages of the goddess. The village has a Three in One temple called Liuyetang 六也堂 (also called the Liuye shuyuan 六也书院) dedicated to Sanyi jiaozhu 三一教主, Yuhuang dadi 玉皇大帝, Xuantian shangdi 玄天上帝 and Guanyin dashi 观音大士.
