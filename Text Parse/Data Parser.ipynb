Bonfires are run across 踏火, opera is performed 演戏, and fireworks are set off 放花. During Yuanxiao 元宵, the gods visit each home to xingdao 行道. This is done in the following way: first, the Fushou 福首 pick up the incense burners from the altar of the Yianshê 义安社 to start the procession (起马). Then prayers are made in the hall of each household. After the procession has circled the mountain (Quanshan 圈山) the incense burners are carried to the Longdonggong 龙洞宫. There, Daoist ritual masters 法师 chant the scriptures. Next, the gods and the incense burners are carried to the Julanting 聚兰亭 and then back to the shê. Finally, at the home of the Fushou who is holding the last incense burner of the previous year, three Daoist ritual masters conduct a Jiao ritual. There were originally only three Fushou but now there are seven. There are three basic requirements for becoming a Fushou. The person has to: 1) take part in the Chunzhai 春斋 Spring Fast (purification) in the first year, and 2) agree to host the Chujiuzao 初九早 (a kind of banquet held on the ninth day of the New Year); and to 3) invite the xianglao 乡老 Village Elders to the feast.
