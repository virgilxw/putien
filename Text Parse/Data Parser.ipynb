Qiantang qijing (Qiantang sevenfold ritual alliance) 钱塘七境 The sevenfold ritual alliance of Qiantang is located alongside the main channel of the Mulan irrigation system in front of the Yangcheng sluice-gate. This area was part of the Qiantang Houxupu 钱塘后许铺 (police/defense unit) of the Guoqingli sub-canton 国清里. There were two villages in this area in the Ming: Qiantang 前塘 and Xiaohengtang 小横塘. In the Qing three other villages branched off: Xiazhuang 下庄, Houxu 后许 and Houyuan 后院. In the late Qing three more villages separated off: Lingding 岭顶, Huangyuan 黄园 and Shangheng 上坑. Currently there are seven natural villages in the area, all administered by the Qijing Administrative Village 七境行政村. The local temple ritual system is divided into the inner four-fold ritual alliance and the outer three-fold ritual alliance. The Lingyinggong 灵应宫 temple, located in Qiantang 钱塘 village, was the original main overall temple of the inner four ritual associations, and is now the overall temple for the entire sevenfold ritual alliance. The main gods worshipped are Liugong yuanshuai 刘公元帅, Zhanggong shengjun 张公圣君, Qiugong yuanshuai 邱公元帅 and Xuantan yuanshuai 玄坛元帅. Each year on lunar 2/25 Liugong yuanshui 刘公元帅, Zhanggong shengjun 张公圣君 and Qiugong yuanshuai 邱公元帅 are invited to go on processon around the villages of the Qiantang sevenfold ritual alliance 钱塘七境. The Peng 彭 and the Chen 陈 were local lineages who produced examination graduates. In Ming Hongzhi 9 (1496) the Censor Zeng Lu 御史曾禄 set up a Shuangfeng 双凤牌坊 (Double Phoenix) memorial archway for the brothers Peng Fu 彭甫 and Peng Shen 彭申 of Xiaohengtang 小横塘 village. In the late Qing feuding banner associations, the inner four-fold ritual associations villages of Qiantang 钱塘, Lingding 岭顶, Houyuan 后院 and Houxu 后许 were part of the black banner alliance. The outer three-fold ritual associations of the villages of Huangyuan 黄园, Xiazhuang 下庄, and Shangkeng 上坑 belonged to the red banner (neutral) village alliance. It is said that the latter villages were once part of the twenty-four wards of Huangshi ritual alliance, and they still participate in the ritual activities of that alliance. \n",

Houji qijing (Houji sevenfold ritual alliance) 后积七境 The sevenfold ritual alliance of Houji is located along the sea-dikes near the mouth of the Mulan 木兰 River. In the early Qing, this region was considered out of bounds (jiewai 界外), and was evacuated. The area was originally part of the Houjipu 后积铺 of Dongxiang 东乡and the Chengkoupu 程口铺 (police/defense units) of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In the Ming there were already the villages of Dongzhang 东张, Houji 后积, Chengkou 澄口, and Yangbin 洋滨. In the Qing, the villages of Qicuo 歧厝 and Louxia 楼下 separated off. Currently the population is over 8000 people, divided into three Administrative Villages, namely Dongfeng 东风, Tingjiang 汀江 and Tingfeng 汀峰. The Wanlinggong 万灵宫 temple, located in Houji village, is the main overall temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main god is Kong Daren 孔大人 and Wulu jiangjun 五路将军. Each year on lunar 1/29 to 2/2, Wulu jiangjun is carried in a procession to the villages of the sevenfold ritual alliance. Every sixty years, Kong Daren is carried in a great procession around scores of villages in the vicinity. These events are organized by the temple committee made up of representatives of the sevenfold ritual alliance, with each village having a voice in the decisions. The Zhu surname of Chengkou 澄口朱 was historically a prominent lineage with many examination graduates, producing two Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan Graduates) and six Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates) during the Ming. In Ming Chenghua 11 (1475) the Regional Inspector 巡按御史 set up a Jinshi 进士牌坊 memorial archway for the Zhu lineage of Chengkou village 澄口朱. In Ming Chenghua (1476) the Putian District Magistrate 莆田知县 set up a Jingbiao zhenjie 旌表贞节牌坊 memorial archway in honor of the Wu lineage of Chengkou village 澄口吴. In Ming Hongzhi 2 (1489), the Xinghua Prefect set up a Chaoyang mingfeng 朝阳鸣凤牌坊 memorial archway in honor of the Zhang lineage of Chengkou 澄口张. \n",
