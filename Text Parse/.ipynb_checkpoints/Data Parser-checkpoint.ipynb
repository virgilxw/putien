In the early Qing, this area was declared off limits (beyond the borders 界外) and was evacuated. Huiyang village was originally part of the Huiyangpu 惠洋铺 of the Lianjiangli sub-canton 连江里. In the Ming the village of Huiyang was already settled, and in the Qing the villages of Dongmian 东面, Fangcuoding 方厝顶 and Duwei 度尾 separated off from Huiyang village. Nowadays all these villages have joined back together into one continuous “natural village”, but with a overall population of over 11,000 people. Huiyang is managed by two Administrative Village Committees: namely Huishang 惠上 and Huixia 惠下. The temple ritual system is divided primarily on the basis of surname groups into eight shê ritual associations. The Fengxunshê 凤浔社 temple of Huishang 惠上 is the founding shê altar of the eight shê of Huiyang (see below), and the Zhenwudian 震武殿 temple Huiyang eight shê ritual alliance of Huixia 惠下 is the main temple of Huiyang (see below). These temples are managed by a temple committee made up of representatives of the eight shê ritual associations. Each year with a intercalary third lunar month, Zunzhu mingwang 尊主明王 and Houtu furen 后土夫人 of Fengxunshê 凤浔社 are taken on a procession to the eight shê altars of the alliance. In the Ming, Houyang was famous as a region that produced examination graduates. The five main lineages of the area, the Fang 方, Zhou 周, Wu 吴, Yu 俞 and Liu 刘 together had six Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan Graduates) and fourteen Juren 举人 (Prefectural Graduates). In Ming Hongzhi 4 (1491), the Xinghua Prefect 兴化知府 set up a Jinshi 进士牌坊 memorial archway in honor of the Fang lineage 方. In Ming Hongzhi 10 (1497), the Xinghua Prefect set up another Jinshi 进士牌坊 memorial archway, this time to honor the Wu lineage 吴. In the feuding banner alliances at the end of the Qing, the eight shê of Huiyang were part of the white banner alliance.

The area was originally part of the Houjipu 后积铺 of Dongxiang 东乡and the Chengkoupu 程口铺 (police/defense units) of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In the Ming there were already the villages of Dongzhang 东张, Houji 后积, Chengkou 澄口, and Yangbin 洋滨. In the Qing, the villages of Qicuo 歧厝 and Louxia 楼下 separated off. Currently the population is over 8000 people, divided into three Administrative Villages, namely Dongfeng 东风, Tingjiang 汀江 and Tingfeng 汀峰. The Wanlinggong 万灵宫 temple, located in Houji village, is the main overall temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main god is Kong Daren 孔大人 and Wulu jiangjun 五路将军. Each year on lunar 1/29 to 2/2, Wulu jiangjun is carried in a procession to the villages of the sevenfold ritual alliance.

These events are organized by the temple committee made up of representatives of the sevenfold ritual alliance, with each village having a voice in the decisions.
