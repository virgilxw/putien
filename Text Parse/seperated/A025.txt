A025 Shaban qijing (Shaban sevenfold ritual alliance) 沙阪七境The sevenfold ritual alliance of Shaban is located along the main channel ofthe Mulan irrigation system in front of the Yangcheng sluice-gate 洋城斗门.This area was part of the Aoshapu 鳌沙铺 (police/self defense unit) of theJingdeli sub-canton 景德里. In the Ming, this area had a village called Shaban 沙阪. In the early Qing two other villages separated off, namely Dutou度头 and Jindunli 金墩里. Currently the area has a population of over 7000people, and is administered by the Shaban Administrative Village 沙坂行政村. The local temple ritual system is divided into the seven ritual associations of Qiaotou 桥头, Xicuo 西厝, Bantou 阪头, Sheqian 社前, Shuxia 树下,Tianba 田坝, Jindun 金墩, and Longdu 龙度.Jinsha lishê 金沙里社 temple of Sheqian 社前 village is the main templefor the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main gods are Zunzhu mingwang 尊主明王 and Houtu furen 后土夫人. Each year during the Yuanxiao festivaleach shê goes to the Jinsha lishê to present incense, and to invite the gods.Each year during the fifth lunar month, each shê in rotation goes to theGuchenggong temple in Huangshi to invite Yanggong taishi 杨公太师 backto their village to watch opera. On a day determined by divination, they holda collective procession.The main surname groups are the Jiang 蒋, Huang 黄, Zhang 张, Zheng郑, Shen 沈 and Wu 吴. Because each lineage lives in close proximity to theothers, each jing association has some members of each of the major surname groups. The main source of livelihood is agriculture, although somepeople work as brick layers 泥工, carpenters 木工 and stone cutters 石工.In the feuding banner alliances of the late Qing, the sevenfold ritual alliance of Shaban were all part of the red banner alliance.
