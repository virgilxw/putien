In the recent years, due to the expansion of the urban area, Nanmen village has been completely modified into an urban neighborhood, and its original settlement structures can no longer be recognized.

The Nanguan Wudimiao 南关五帝庙 is the main temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance 七境总宫. The main god is Wuhuang dadi 五皇大帝. Each Nanmen sevenfold ritual alliance year on 1/20, Wuhuang dadi is taken on a procession around the seven jing of the ritual alliance.

This area had the village of Baihushi 白湖市 in the Song, and the market streets of Kuokou 阔口街 in the Ming. In the late Song and early to mid-Ming, Kuokou village was near the site of the closest harbor for boats coming up the mouth of the Mulan river 木兰溪 to deliver goods to Putian city.
