The area was originally part of the Houjipu 后积铺 of Dongxiang 东乡and the Chengkoupu 程口铺 (police/defense units) of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In the Ming there were already the villages of Dongzhang 东张, Houji 后积, Chengkou 澄口, and Yangbin 洋滨. In the Qing, the villages of Qicuo 歧厝 and Louxia 楼下 separated off.

The Wanlinggong 万灵宫 temple, located in Houji village, is the main overall temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main god is Kong Daren 孔大人 and Wulu jiangjun 五路将军. Each year on lunar 1/29 to 2/2, Wulu jiangjun is carried in a procession to the villages of the sevenfold ritual alliance.

These events are organized by the temple committee made up of representatives of the sevenfold ritual alliance, with each village having a voice in the decisions.
