A001 Beitou sishê (Beitou four shê ritual alliance) 陂头四社The four shê ritual alliance of Beitou (Head of the Weir) is situated along theside of the main irrigation channel that emerges directly from the side of theMulan Weir and proceeds straight through the southern irrigated plain. Thiswas the main channel first dug in 1082. This area was originally part of theMulanbeipu 木兰陂铺 (police/defense unit) and the Baidulingpu 白杜岭铺of the Weixinli sub-canton 维新里. In the Ming, the village of Beitou 陂头was already settled in this area. In the early Qing the villages of Tiezao 铁灶and Baiyuling 白玉岭 separated off and became independent villages. In thelate Qing, the village of Wumen 吴门 branched off as well.The Xieying Li Zhangzhemiao 协应李长者庙 and the Qianfeimiao 钱妃庙by the side of the Mulan Weir were the main overall temples of the four shêalliance of Beitou 总宫, and each year during the Yuanxiao festival the godsof these temples would be carried in a procession through the villages of thealliance. Currently, the Li Zhangzhe miao has been turned into the MulanWeir Irrigation System Museum 木兰陂水利纪念馆, and the Qianfeimiaohas turned into the village temple of Beitou village 陂头村. Thus the Yuanxiao overall procession has not yet been revived.The original inhabitants of the Beitou four shê alliance were the descendants of founders of the Mulan Weir, Li Hong 李宏 and the descendantsof the Fourteen Families of Shuinan responsible for the maintenance of theMulan irrigation system. For this reason, most of the villages in the allianceare mixed surname villages. In the late Qing feuding banner alliances, theBeitou four shê ritual alliance belonged to the red banner alliance.
