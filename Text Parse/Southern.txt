A001 Beitou sishê (Beitou four shê ritual alliance) 陂头四社 The four shê ritual alliance of Beitou (Head of the Weir) is situated along the side of the main irrigation channel that emerges directly from the side of the Mulan Weir and proceeds straight through the southern irrigated plain. This was the main channel first dug in 1082. This area was originally part of the Mulanbeipu 木兰陂铺 (police/defense unit) and the Baidulingpu 白杜岭铺 of the Weixinli sub-canton 维新里. In the Ming, the village of Beitou 陂头 was already settled in this area. In the early Qing the villages of Tiezao 铁灶 and Baiyuling 白玉岭 separated off and became independent villages. In the late Qing, the village of Wumen 吴门 branched off as well. The Xieying Li Zhangzhemiao 协应李长者庙 and the Qianfeimiao 钱妃庙 by the side of the Mulan Weir were the main overall temples of the four shê alliance of Beitou 总宫, and each year during the Yuanxiao festival the gods of these temples would be carried in a procession through the villages of the alliance. Currently, the Li Zhangzhe miao has been turned into the Mulan Weir Irrigation System Museum 木兰陂水利纪念馆, and the Qianfeimiao has turned into the village temple of Beitou village 陂头村. Thus the Yuanxiao overall procession has not yet been revived. The original inhabitants of the Beitou four shê alliance were the descendants of founders of the Mulan Weir, Li Hong 李宏 and the descendants of the Fourteen Families of Shuinan responsible for the maintenance of the Mulan irrigation system. For this reason, most of the villages in the alliance are mixed surname villages. In the late Qing feuding banner alliances, the Beitou four shê ritual alliance belonged to the red banner alliance. 
V001 Beitou 陂头 1. Village settlement Beitou village is part of the Mulan Administrative Village 木兰行政村. The total population of Beitou is approximately 800 people.

The ritual alliance includes Goukou 沟口, Xiaqutou 下渠头 Qiandun 前墩, Zhongdun 中墩, and Houdun 后墩. In the Ming, the villages of Henggou 横沟 and Qianhuang 前黄 were inhabited. In the Qing, the following villages branched off from these settlements: Goukou 沟口, Gouxia 沟东, Gouxi 沟西, Qiandun 前墩, Zhongdun 中墩, Houdun 后墩, Qingcha 青垞 and Wangzhuang 王庄, a total of eight villages in all. Wangzhuang 王庄 is now called Yunzhuang 云庄, which was part of the Wangzhuang zhenwei pu 王庄圳尾铺 of Hugongli sub-canton 胡公里, but because the early village settlers were Wangs 王 who were related to and divided off from the Wangs of Qingcha village 青垞王, this village also is part of the Goukou sevenfold ritual alliance 沟口七境. The Xiangshangong 香山宫 temple, located in the village lands of Qingcha 青垞 village, was originally the main temple of the Goutou Thirteen Village alliance 沟头十三乡 as well as being the main temple of the Goukou sevenfold ritual alliance 沟口七境. The main goddess of the temple is Qianshi shengfei 钱氏圣妃, with secondary gods Li Zhen 黎畛, Dashi 大使 and Ershi 二使.

Currently, Qingcha 青垞, Goukou 沟口, and Yunzhuang 云庄 still go to the Xiangshangong to invite the goddess, but the ritual alliances have not yet revived the general processions and collective rituals. During the Ming and Qing, the Huang 黄 and the Chen 陈 lineages were prominent lineages with successful examination candidates. In Qianhuang 前黄 there was a Jinshi (Metropolitan Graduate) 进士牌坊 memorial arch, and in Henggou 横沟 there was a Zhenjie (Chaste Widow) 贞节牌坊 memorial arch.

In the early Qing two other villages separated off, namely Dutou 度头 and Jindunli 金墩里. Currently the area has a population of over 7000 people, and is administered by the Shaban Administrative Village 沙坂行 政村. The local temple ritual system is divided into the seven ritual associations of Qiaotou 桥头, Xicuo 西厝, Bantou 阪头, Sheqian 社前, Shuxia 树下, Tianba 田坝, Jindun 金墩, and Longdu 龙度.

On a day determined by divination, they hold a collective procession. The main surname groups are the Jiang 蒋, Huang 黄, Zhang 张, Zheng 郑, Shen 沈 and Wu 吴. Because each lineage lives in close proximity to the others, each jing association has some members of each of the major surname groups. The main source of livelihood is agriculture, although some people work as brick layers 泥工, carpenters 木工 and stone cutters 石工. In the feuding banner alliances of the late Qing, the sevenfold ritual alliance of Shaban were all part of the red banner alliance.

A058 Lingyun shangshibaxiang (Lingyun eighteen village ritual alliance)
凌云上十八乡
The Lingyun upper eighteen village alliance is located at the feet of the
Hugong Mountain 壶公山麓 at the far reaches of the Mulan 木兰 irrigation system of the Southern irrigated plain. In the early Qing, these villages
were declared out of bounds 界外, and they were forcibly evacuated. This
area was part of the Meilong qianpupu 梅陇前埔铺 (police/defense unit),
the Shentang longjinpu 沈塘龙津铺, the Lingcuopu 凌厝铺 and the Qianting Qicaipu 前亭祁蔡铺of Anleli 安乐里 sub-canton and the Chicenpu
赤岑铺 of Guoqingli 国清里 sub-canton. In the Ming, this area had the villages of Xintang 新塘, Jiaojinyang 交津洋, Meilong 梅陇, Daban 大阪, and
Qiling 祁凌. In the early Qing the following villages separated off: Longcuo
陇厝, Qianpu 前埔, Xincuo 新厝, Gouwei 沟尾, Qianwei 前尾, Lingcuo
凌厝, Qianting 前亭, Qicuo 祁厝, Caicuo 蔡厝, Dongsong 东宋, Huangzhaipu 黄宅埔, Liucuo 刘厝, and Yingcuo 缨厝. More recently, the following villages have separated off: Xiagou 下沟, Yingbian 营边, Kengbei 坑北,
and Baita 白塔. There are now over twenty natural villages in the area, which
are managed by the following eight Administrative Villages: Gouwei 沟尾,
Longtou 龙头, Daban 大坂, Dongsong 东宋, Lingcuo 凌厝, Liucuo 刘厝,
Qicuo 歧厝, Lingmei 岭美.
Mingshangong 名山宫 temple, which is located on the foothills of Hushan
mountain 壶公山 in the Shanxiangjing 善乡境 is the main temple for the
upper eighteen village alliance. The main god of the temple is Huanggong
yuanshuai 黄公元帅, whose feast day is celebrated on lunar 8/9. The secondary gods are Tianshang wuji shengmu 天上无极圣母, Haoyu dishi 俣玉

This monastery was in existence already in the Sui Dynasty, and is dedicated
to Guanyin dashi 观音大士 with secondary gods Jintong 金童, Yunü 玉女,
Weituo 韦陀 and Jialan 伽蓝. Also attached to the temple is the Jiuxiandong
九仙洞 cavern-temple. The villages of the alliance take turns inviting the
gods of this temple to their home village temples to watch opera. Each year
with an intercalary second lunar month, the gods go on a procession to all
the eighteen villages of the ritual alliance.
Historically, the Xu lineage of Meilong 梅陇徐氏 and the Zheng 郑 lineage of Daban, were two prominent lineages in this area renowned for their
examination graduates. In the Ming the Xu lineage produced three Jinshi
进士 (Metropolitan Graduates) and eight Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates)
while the Zheng lineage produced two Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan Graduates)
and two Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates).

Hengtang 横塘)

1. Village settlement Hengtang was also called Hengqu 横渠 in the Tang.
Hengtang is located in between the Shangxia 上下渠大沟 main channel and
the main channel in front of the Yangcheng sluice-gate 洋城斗门前大沟 of
the Mulan irrigation system. This area was part of the Hengtangpu (police/
defense unit) of Anleli 安乐里 sub-canton. In the Tang dynasty, the area
already had a village called Hengtang, and the village currently has more
than 4000 people. In the local temple ritual system, they are divided according to lineage and settlement into seven jia ritual associations.
In the Ming, Hengtang was famous for its examination graduates, and
the six lineages of the Peng 彭, Qiu 邱, Zhu 朱, Zhang 张, Lin 林, and Chen
陈 of this village together produced eighteen Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan
Graduates) and thirty Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates). In Ming Tianshu
4 (1460) the Xinghua Prefect 兴化知府 set up a Xiuyi 繍衣牌坊 memorial
archway in honor of the Lin lineage 林. In Ming Chenghua 12 (1476) the
Fujian Provincial Administration Commissioner 福建布政使 set up a Xiuyi
繍衣牌坊 memorial archway in honor of the Qiu lineage 邱. There still survives a stele from Qianlong 59 (1794) inscribed with the words “Tangqing
wujian 塘清武鉴”. The inscription reads further: “Tang yuanhe wuzi (808)
Metropolitan Graduate and Editor in the Palace Library Zhang Shi 张实
bequeathed land to build a hall. Song Taiping Tianguo xuyin (808) General of the Palace Army Zhang Songhui 张忪恢 expanded it; Song Shaoxing
renzi (1132) Grand Master for Closing Court Zhang Dounan 张斗南 rebuilt
the hall.” The stone inscription composed by Peng Peng 彭鹏 in Kangxi 30
(1691), entitled 横塘彭氏宗祠春祀记 (Record of the Spring sacrifice at the
Hengtang Peng main ancestral hall), is about the Peng Ancestral hall of this
village (Epigraphical Materials, 1995:222, No. 192).
In the feuding banner alliances of the late Qing, the seven jia ritual associations of Hengtang were part of the white banner alliance.
