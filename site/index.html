			<h2>A Seemingly Ordinary City</h2>
			<p>
				This is Pútián 莆田, a city in Fújiàn 福建 province of China. Most of the city’s 2.7 million residents lives on the Putian Plain located at the mouth of the Mulan 木兰River. Putian Plain, however, is not a natural formation.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the ancient shoreline of Putian. The modern Putian Plain was reclaimed from Xinghua 兴化 Bay in a process which took over a thousand years. Reclaimation first began during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The ocean was slowly filled in with landfill, while lowland mudflats were drained with irrigation canals, sea dikes, and weirs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process of reclaimation accelerated during the Song (960–1279) Dynasty as greater numbers of Han Chinese migrated into the Putian Plain. The pre-industrial limits to reclaimation were reached during the Qing dynasty (636–1912), even though reclaimation projects continue in the twenty-first century.

			<h2>Putian’s Hydrological Conundrum</h2>
			<p>
				Newly drained land took the form of barren mudflats. A system of irrigation canals and weirs developed concurently to transform mudflats into productive rice-growing agricultural fields, and to reclaim new land from the ocean.
			</p>
			<p>
				Putian’s irrigation system is extraordinarily complex and interconnected to meet the challenges of its distinct hydrological challanges. Salt water enters deep into the plain on the rising tide, pushing up the Mulan river to the Mulan Weir, located southwest of Putian city. The irrigation system is used as a reservoir of freshwater and requires constant operation to be effective. Several weirs divert freshwater from the moutains into the region’s irrigation canals, while sluice gates are opened and closed twice daily in time with the tides of the sea. Water is refilled into these temporary reservoirs during high tide. During low tide, water is released to mitigate saltwater intrusion.

			<h2>The Ritual Alliances of the Putian Plain</h2>
			<p>
				To manage the hydrological infrastructure, the residents of the Putian Plains developed <b>Ritual Alliances</b>. Although Ritual Alliances and lineage clan exist throughout China, Putian’s Ritual Alliances developed elaborate forms to run the hydrological management system, managing conflicts and the distribution of resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ritual alliances of the Putian plains are groups of villages which perform regular everyday rituals, share a higher order temple with a temple committee made up of representatives of each village in the alliance, and organise annual (or longer temporal cycles) processions of the gods through each of the villages in the alliance. These alliances are based in higher order temples. The gods of these temples are borrowed by smaller temples for rituals held there, or else they are formally received by these temples when they are carried in processions around the villages of the alliance.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Look at nothing in defiance of ritual, listen to nothing in defiance of ritual, speak of nothing in defiance or ritual, never stir hand or foot in defiance of ritual.
				<footer>Confucius, The Analects</footer>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				Ritual Alliances are often multi-lineage defensive alliances, and as para-political organisations that settle local and cross-boundary disputes with a formal legal code. Their functions were primarily defense, insurance, crop patrols, and irrigation maintenance. These alliances were also based in higher order temples, often in open country, which offered a more extensive range of ritual services than smaller, village temples. Large collective rites were held on the birthdays of the main gods of these temples, and every ten years a great Daoist Jiao 醮 ritual would be held. These rituals featured fighting over firework displays.
			</p>
			<p>
				These Ritual Alliances generate a “second government” which addresses particular local concerns more effectively than the state and its local government officials. Operated from the thousands of temples which dot rural and urban Putian, village or urban temples, Ritual Alliances and temples are important centers of local political, economic, social and moral power. Often, when one visits a village temple, it is a leader of the temple’s governing Ritual Alliances which greets you.
			</p>
			<p>
				The imperial governments of China proved too distant to micromanage Putian’s water resources. Historically, the Chinese government has adopted a distant supervisory attitute to the public works of Putian. Imperial governments may have played an initial role in marshalling funds and corvée labour, but would subsequently hand off most construction and management tasks to local institutions who were more responsive. A robust imperial system is, however, still needed for the effective management of water resources. Imperial governments punished sabotuers of public infrastructure, mediated disputes between local factions, and protected the region from the devastation of open warfare.
			</p>
			<p>
				INSERT: During the Qing Dynasty, the dire need for soldiers transformed Ritual Alliances into para-military organisations with formal militia units, who fought over land rent and the control of markets, and who could form military allegiances between alliances.
