The Zheng of Puban fi rst moved from the South Gate of Putian walled city aft er they were bullied by the Lin 林. They moved fi rst to Yangcheng 洋埕 and Yangzhong 洋中, and later moved to Puban. In the Ming Zhengde period (1506–1521), the local resident Zheng Yue 郑岳, who had served as Vice-Minister of Revenue, had a tertiary irrigation canal dug leading into the Puban area from a secondary channel of the Mulan irrigation system. This would cause large-scale problems within the irrigation system as a whole, but it did bring immediate benefi t to the Puban area. Zheng Yue also built the Puban lishê 蒲阪里社. The Zheng now occupy the four villages of Xijiao 西角, Houzheng 后郑, Yaogou 腰沟, and Goucen 沟岑. The Zheng make up more than 3000 people. The Dai 戴 have more than 1700 people. They are settled in Houdaijiao 后戴角 village.

Currently, Shiting village has developed relatively independent temple ritual system, called the 石庭四甲 (the four jia (ritual associations) of Shiting). Meanwhile, Shangfang village has become a subordinate neighborhood of the greater Shiting village.</p><p>Originally the Shangfanggong 上方宫, with its Fuxing dongshê 福兴东 社, was the main temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance, and on set dates it would organize joint processions and hold god’s the birthday celebrations, along with guanjie training sessions for spirit mediums. The main gods of the temple were Erdian zhenjun 二殿真君, Zunshu mingwang 尊主明王 and Houtu furen 后土夫人.

Currently, the Huang lineage of Shiting has evolved a relatively independent ritual system, known as the Shiting sijia 石庭四甲 (Four neighborhoods of Shiting).
