This area was part of the Qiantang Houxupu 钱塘后许铺 (police/defense unit) of the Guoqingli sub-canton 国清里. There were two villages in this area in the Ming: Qiantang 前塘 and Xiaohengtang 小横塘. In the Qing three other villages branched off: Xiazhuang 下庄, Houxu 后许 and Houyuan 后院. In the late Qing three more villages separated off: Lingding 岭顶, Huangyuan 黄园 and Shangheng 上坑. Currently there are seven natural villages in the area, all administered by the Qijing Administrative Village 七境行政村. The local temple ritual system is divided into the inner four-fold ritual alliance and the outer three-fold ritual alliance. The Lingyinggong 灵应宫 temple, located in Qiantang 钱塘 village, was the original main overall temple of the inner four ritual associations, and is now the overall temple for the entire sevenfold ritual alliance. The main gods worshipped are Liugong yuanshuai 刘公元帅, Zhanggong shengjun 张公圣君, Qiugong yuanshuai 邱公元帅 and Xuantan yuanshuai 玄坛元帅.",

The Peng 彭 and the Chen 陈 were local lineages who produced examination graduates.

In the late Qing feuding banner associations, the inner four-fold ritual associations villages of Qiantang 钱塘, Lingding 岭顶, Houyuan 后院 and Houxu 后许 were part of the black banner alliance. The outer three-fold ritual associations of the villages of Huangyuan 黄园, Xiazhuang 下庄, and Shangkeng 上坑 belonged to the red banner (neutral) village alliance. It is said that the latter villages were once part of the twenty-four wards of Huangshi ritual alliance, and they still participate in the ritual activities of that alliance.",

Dongshan sishê (Dongshan four shê ritual alliance) 东山四社 Dongshan is also called ZouZengXu 邹曾徐 and Sancuo 三厝. It is located between the Houyang main channel 后洋大沟 of the Mulan 木兰 irrigation system and the coastal sea dikes below the mouth of the Mulan river, near the Dongshan sluice-gate. It was originally part of the Zouzengxupu 邹曾 徐铺 of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In this area in the Ming there already was a village called Zou Zeng Xu 邹曾徐. Currently, the population of Dongshan is over 10,000 people, and it is managed by two Administrative Villages: Dongshan 东山行政村 and Dongyuan 东源行政村. The temple ritual system is divided on the basis of residence and lineage into the four shê ritual associations of Shangzou 上邹, Xiazou 下邹, Dongcuo 东厝, and Zhengcuo 郑厝. The Chongjiaogong 崇教宫 of Shangzou village 上邹 (see below) is the main temple for the four shê ritual association. The two main surnames of this area are the Zou 邹 and the Zheng 郑. The Zou have over 6000 people. The Zou ancestors are said to have emigrated from Zou county of Shandong province 山东邹县 to Putian 莆田 during the Jianyan period of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127–1130). In the Ming dynasty, the Zou were a prominent lineage with many successful examination Dongshan four shê ritual alliance graduates. They produced two Jinshi 进士 (Metropolitan Graduates) and seven Juren 举人 (Provincial Graduates). The Fancan Family Temple 藩参 家庙, first built in Ming Jiajing 29 (1550) and still extant, is the ancestral lineage hall of the Zou of Dongshan 东山, as well as of the Zou of Xindu 新度 and Xiyuan 西园, etc. In the feuding banner alliances of the late Qing, the four shê of Dongshan were part of the black banner alliance.",

Houji qijing (Houji sevenfold ritual alliance) 后积七境 The sevenfold ritual alliance of Houji is located along the sea-dikes near the mouth of the Mulan 木兰 River. In the early Qing, this region was considered out of bounds (jiewai 界外), and was evacuated. The area was originally part of the Houjipu 后积铺 of Dongxiang 东乡and the Chengkoupu 程口铺 (police/defense units) of the Xingfuli sub-canton 兴福里. In the Ming there were already the villages of Dongzhang 东张, Houji 后积, Chengkou 澄口, and Yangbin 洋滨. In the Qing, the villages of Qicuo 歧厝 and Louxia 楼下 separated off. Currently the population is over 8000 people, divided into three Administrative Villages, namely Dongfeng 东风, Tingjiang 汀江 and Tingfeng 汀峰. The Wanlinggong 万灵宫 temple, located in Houji village, is the main overall temple of the sevenfold ritual alliance. The main god is Kong Daren 孔大人 and Wulu jiangjun 五路将军.",
